<p>The following discourse was prepared as a lecture. With
the exception of the insertion of passages which it was
found necessary to omit in delivery, on account of too
great length, it is printed as it was spoken. It addressed, and
in its present form addresses, thoughtful and earnest minds,
not concerned specially with questions of philosophy, metaphysics,
and science, but alive to the advanced knowledge and
thought of our times, and anxious to know, so far as in such a
form it could be expressed, how the great foundation of
religious belief, the existence of Deity, is affected by the
splendid advance of our knowledge of nature. To have
written more than the following pages contain, in answering
this desire, would have necessitated what I have
earnestly endeavoured to avoid, a change from a discourse
into a treatise. It is hoped that, as it is presented, it may
to some extent be found useful to those who sought it—not
so much students, as men interested in the deeper
thought of our age, but whose time is occupied with the
labours and engagements of a busy life.</p>

</div>


<p>In spite of the lucid and far-reaching reasoning of Hume,
which aimed at effacing causality from our conceptions of
phenomena, and making invariable sequence supplant it;
in spite of Auguste Comte’s stern effort to ‘get rid of the
vain pretension to investigate the causes of phenomena,’
and the affirmation that ‘forces are only movements, produced
or tending to produce;’ nay, in spite of all the
logical effort of all the following years, there remains
unaltered, that inalienable property of the human mind,
consciousness of power; the ability to realize ‘I can’
simultaneously with ‘I am.’ In this originates our
universal explanation of external phenomena. Because
we can act and produce phenomena, we infer that all
phenomena were inevitably produced by some transcendent
but equivalent act of conscious power. If we think of a
plane surface or a sphere, we can only think of them as
occupants of space: so, if we think of the light beams of
Sirius, or the motion of Mars, we realize the normal
necessity of thinking of them ultimately as caused. This
is an inevitable sequence of our consciousness, reason, and
experience. A phenomenon appearing in time evokes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
mental demand for something which is not that phenomenon,
but without which it would not have existed.</p>

<p>In this lies the insatiable desire of mind to peer into the
origin of, and reason for, the existence of this universe.
Deepening knowledge brings broader light and expanding
mystery, but this only quickens the intellectual purpose of
the race to seek to solve the problem, why we are circled
with the splendid phenomena of heaven and earth, and
possessed of the mystery of ourselves?</p>

<p>But to meet this mental demand is no part of the
business of science. The study of phenomena, their
succession and their classification, is the essential work of
science. It has no function, and is possessed of no instrument
with which to look behind or below the sequence, in
quest of some higher relation. The eye and the mind of the
experimentalist know only of antecedent and consequent.
These fill the whole circle of his research; let him find
these, and he has found all. But since a cause is no more
a phenomenon, than a thought is a material manifestation,
that which fills the whole circumference claimed by science
does <i>not</i> fill all the area legitimately held by reason. A
prevision of the order, and the methods of the changes of
the universe, is the ideal of science. But mind in its
entirety refuses to be locked within such limits. It looks
deeper than sequences, and farther back than phenomena;
it demands, by the very laws of its existence, their cause.
A continuity of transformed causes undoubtedly explains
a wide, and ever-widening area of sequences. But that
cannot annul the demand of reason for causation. It
simply drives it farther back, and higher up, and indicates
that the modes of action and relation originated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
primal cause are only the more sublimely rhythmic. Count
this a lingering survival of ‘mere metaphysics’ who will,
it is withal so stalwart, so perennial in our consciousness,
amidst all vicissitudes of knowledge and reasoning, that
whatever science may do, philosophy must give it
audience.</p>

<p>The researches of science, then, are physical. The
observable, finite contents of space and time are the
subjects of its analysis. Existence, not the cause of
existence, succession, not the reason of succession, method,
not the origin of method, are the subjects of physical
research. A primordial cause cannot be the subject of
experiment nor the object of demonstration. It must
for ever transcend the most delicate physical reaction, the
profoundest analysis, and the last link in the keenest logic.
Absolute knowledge concerning it can only be the prerogative
of itself.</p>

<p>But human reason is not only, and wholly, concerned
with the brilliant records of physical enquiry: it is
conscious of powers within itself that transcend and elude
all the processes of physics, and the analyses of mathematics.
The activities of the mind are not exhausted, the
demands of the mind are not met, the persistent questions
of reason are not answered, by all the processes, all the
products, and all the possibilities of physical research
combined.</p>

<p>Science refuses absolutely to recognise mind as the
primal cause of the sequences of matter. This is just;—within
the strict region of its research; for phenomena, their
sequences and classification, are its sole domain. But
observe, science, universally, puts <i>force</i> where the reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
asks for cause. The forces affecting matter are tacitly
assumed to be competent to account for every activity,
every sequence, every phenomenon, and all the harmonies
of universal being. A nexus for the infinite diversities and
harmonies, a basis for all the equilibrium of nature, is found
by modern science in force. But force is as absolutely
inscrutable as mind. Force can never be known in itself;
it is known by its manifestations. It is not a phenomenon;
it produces phenomena. We cannot know it; but we know
nothing without it.</p>

<p>Then the ultimate analysis of physical science is the
relations of force and matter. But force is a subject of
knowledge to science only in its manifestations; that is,
motion. In irreducible terms, therefore, the final analysis
of science is <i>matter as affected by motion</i>. These—matter
and motion—are held by many advanced physicists to be
the primary elements of all phenomena; the most minute,
subtile, and occult reaction, and the most majestic cosmic
manifestation are held to be explained by these. Thus the
whole cosmos, with its infinite complexities and harmonies,
arose in space, and is in space, because of the affections of
matter by motion. To search out the motions on which all
changes are based, to reduce all the activities of the
universe, from the awful movement of a constellation, to
the rhythmic swing of an atom; from the origin of mind,
and the writing of Faust, to the building of a snow crystal,
or the production of a flower, to sheer mechanics—matter
affected by motion—is held to be the chief mission of
science.</p>

<p>But examine for a moment the nature of the problem.
The matter with which analysis is thus finally concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
cannot be matter as we know it. It is the existing
<i>properties</i> or <i>qualities</i> of matter that affect us. Matter is
hard, it is yellow, it is sweet. Now the very qualities that
<i>make</i> matter as we know it are demonstrated by modern
science to be but ‘modes of motion;’ matter is hot because
the ultimate atoms of it vibrate in a special manner. The
yellowness of an object is not in <i>it</i>, but in our percipient
faculty. That which is yellow emits certain light vibrations
only; these affect the retina in a special manner, and
this affection we call the perception of yellowness. It is
thus with all the qualities of matter.</p>

<p>Then what can that ‘matter’ be with which the physicist
must ultimately and in the beginning deal? When matter
is divested of all its qualities, divested in thought of all the
‘modes of motion’ by which it manifests itself to us, what
is it? Is it mass, wholly incapable of affecting our senses?
Matter <i>sine perceptione</i>? That cannot be a thing, it is an
abstraction, and he must be something more than a bold
man, who would logically infer an actual factor, corresponding
to the abstract conception.</p>

<p>Manifestly, then, physical science and its methods cannot
illuminate and explain all the dilating area of space, and
flow of time, with which our consciousness and reason are
concerned. Shapes and motion, form and number, are not
data that can carry us to the origin of the universe. You
must import an unacknowledged factor. Force stands
ready: if you endow <i>it</i>, in imagination equipped in the
uniform of science, with the very qualities of mind, no
doubt you may cross the boundary of experimental science,
and see in matter affected by motion the possibility of all
that is. But, says Professor Huxley, ‘<i>Kraft und Stoff</i>—force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
and matter—are paraded as the Alpha and Omega of
existence. This, I apprehend, is the fundamental article of
the faith materialistic, and whosoever does not hold it is
condemned by the more zealous of the persuasion (as I have
some reason to know) to the Inferno appointed for fools
and hypocrites. But all this,’ he continues, ‘I heartily
disbelieve; and ... I will briefly give my reasons for
persisting in my infidelity. In the first place, ... it seems
to me pretty plain that there is a third thing in the
universe, to wit, consciousness, which, in the hardness of
my heart or head, I cannot see to be matter, or force, or
any conceivable modification of either, however intimately
the manifestations of the phenomena of consciousness may
be connected with the phenomena known as matter and
force. In the second place, the arguments used by Descartes
and Berkeley to show that our certain knowledge does not
extend beyond our states of consciousness, appear to me to
be as irrefragable now as they did when I first became
acquainted with them, some half-century ago. All the
materialistic writers I know of, who have tried to bite that
file, have simply broken their teeth. But if this is true,
our one certainty is the existence of the mental world; and
that of <i>Kraft und Stoff</i> falls into the rank of, at best, a
highly probable hypothesis.’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Look, then, at the striking incongruity. With no
explanation of matter without qualities; with no indication
of how motion could arise and become rhythmic and infinitely
harmonious; with the distinct knowledge that, when
the physicist wants to demonstrate matter, he is compelled
to do it in terms of motion; and, when he would prove the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
presence of motion, he can only do it in terms of matter;
with all these fetters to our mental movement, and clouds
before our eyes, it is argued that, by carrying the discoverable
and apparently self-acting affections of matter by
motion far enough back, we can explain the origin and
structure of the universe.</p>

<p>I would repeat, that in such a mental effort, it is vain to
seek logical aid from the employment of the word ‘force.’
We have seen that the only scientific idea of force we can
ever have, is motion. Motion is the result of ever-varying
relations, borne to each other by matter, space, and time. At
a given instant a body is here; in a measurable interval after,
it is not here, but yonder. ‘Motion’ carries with it no occult
constructive power. It is change of place, and no more.</p>

<p>Is it not inevitable, then, that the mind should refuse its
sanction to the claim, that ‘the problem of the universe’
is solved by these feeble factors? ‘If I were forced,’
writes Professor Huxley, ‘to choose between Materialism
and Idealism, I should elect for the latter;’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and truly, if
our choice must be between them, this is the normal
alternative.</p>

<p>The loftiest object of human thought is to discover how
far the material universe is en expression of supreme unity,
of rhythmic activity, and of rational order. But for this,
the mind must take a range that transcends, without limit,
all physical sequences, laws, phenomena. Taking the broad
basis of our consciousness and reasoning faculties, we must
<i>relate</i> sequences, <i>interpret</i> phenomena, and, however remotely
and imperfectly, endeavour to account for ‘laws.’
But in doing this we must remember that we have pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
our way beyond the last outpost of <i>physical</i> research. We
have passed beyond the region where ‘quod erat demonstrandum’
is used. We have threaded our mental path
into solitudes where no electrometer will be responsive, no
spectroscope analytical, no lens revealing. We have come
to the edge of all that we <i>know</i> and can <i>demonstrate</i>; and
then, impelled by the moral and rational light within us,
we judge and balance all that we know, and all that we
are, and we reach, not a demonstration, for that cannot be,
but a conviction, a moral and intellectual certainty, of the
being of a primordial cause, which is second, in its firmness
and security, to nothing within the area of mind.</p>

<p>Since the time of Newton and Leibnitz the laws of
ordinary dynamics have been settled; but between dynamics,
and the so-called ‘imponderable forces,’ by which it was
assumed that an explanation was furnished of heat, chemical
action, electricity, magnetism and the rest, there was a great
gulf. That has been bridged over by a common measure
of value, giving rise to a general dynamic law of all the
forces of the universe. This is known as the ‘Conservation
of Energy.’ It demonstrates, with more or less completeness,
that all physical phenomena are the different appearances
resulting from different groupings of matter by force. Both
matter and force are eternally changeless in quantity.
They can be neither diminished nor increased, neither
created nor destroyed. The ‘modes of motion’ that produce
the varied phenomena are interchangeable. Light
may become heat, heat may become electricity; but there
is no loss. When motion seems to disappear, it is only
transferred into another mode. The phenomena of light,
heat, electricity, result from changes wrought in matter by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
motion. Every ray of sunshine, for instance, is an interwoven
group of powerful energies. Whence do they come? From
changes in the matter of the sun. For every measure of sunshine
received by the earth an equivalent measure of solar
matter has been changed. Through the sunbeam the varied
forms of energy produced in the sun have been received, and
stored up on this earth. For incalculable centuries the
world has been clothed with abundant vegetation. This
will only grow in sunlight. The energies in the sunbeam
act on living matter, as on a spore or a seed, causing it to
grow. That is to say, under the influence of vital action,
the forces of the sunbeam are changed into wood. A
section from a pine mast, or an oak trunk, stands for a
measurable quantity of sunshine. But coal is wood; forests
buried and carbonized. Coal then has, as it were, fixed
the energies of the sunbeams that poured upon the earth
millions of years ago. Put coal where it will be in contact
with oxygen and heat, and what follows? You get heat,
light, chemical action; that is to say, the locked-up energies
of the sunbeams of a measureless past are set free.</p>

<p>Here then, all the activity of the universe, every phenomenon,
and every vibration of every atom, from the centre
to the margin of the immeasurable whole, is directly related
to a unity of primal power. Nothing has happened to-day
in the remotest or nearest part of creation, but was linked
in an unbroken chain to the first throb that thrilled the
incipient universe in the mystery of ‘the beginning.’
Nothing is isolated through all duration and all space.
Because, everywhere and always, the resulting phenomena
are self-acting and rhythmic to our mode of research, shall
we say that they have no cause, or that they have determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
their own condition? because we find that the
self-adjustments and sublimity of Nature, transcend infinitely
all the conceptions of earlier generations, will it be
logical to argue, that therefore Nature may be the more
readily explained as causeless and devoid of mind? that,
being self-adjusting and self-acting, it needed no cause? or
shall we not the rather realize that this unbroken line of
physical continuity and interaction through all duration to
‘the beginning’ brings us <i>there</i>, face to face, with the
inscrutable Power, by which that unchanging unity and
continuity of purposeful action was caused?</p>

<p>Every phenomenon is motion; motion can only begin in
force. Within the range of human experience and thought,
as it has been long without answer contended, there is no
force known but <i>will</i>: could any other cause than the
volition of a mind, have primarily directed force to affect
matter so as to produce, for ever, the infinite harmonies
and self-adjusting interactions of this vast Universe?</p>

<p>The very intellect, which finds so noble a vocation in
the researches of science, and which is so brilliantly
employed in penetrating into, and opening up, the <i>intelligibility</i>
of the physical universe; and by that means
demonstrating the <i>congruousness</i> of the cosmos; is the same
intellect that is conscious of <i>itself</i>, and of its <i>power</i>; which
knows itself as possessed of causative capacity; and which
has absolutely no other source of knowledge concerning
power, save that which arises in itself. The very rationality
of the Creation, in our deepest analysis and broadest survey
of it, leads the mind, by the conditions inseverable from
its reasoning faculties, to see in its perfect relations the
inevitable congruity of an intelligent cause. And all this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
be it observed, results <i>after</i> science has disclosed the
splendid treasures of its knowledge, the beauty and indisputable
accuracy of its methods, and the new senses with
which it has endowed itself by its instruments. Yes; the
mind goes out to this conclusion, not defiant of science, but
gratefully paying toll to it for an infinitely enlightening
and ennobling passage through the marvels of phenomena,
and the splendour of Nature’s methods, right to the very
margin, beyond which science herself declares she cannot
go; and although the physicist may declare he does not
need it, and the mathematician that he can dispense with
it, although all their immediate problems can be worked
without it, yet the mind goes forth on the wings of its
rational powers, its moral consciousness, its judgment; and
leaving the margin of matter, it seeks audience, as it were,
with the very mystery that enshrouds the universe; and it
rises to the conviction that its quest has not been vain; it has
realized, dimly, imperfectly, and, as it were, faint with awe,
the necessity of the presence and action of Eternal Mind.</p>

<p>No search into the relations of matter and motion can
ever affect our consciousness of causality. We cannot
be conscious of our own being without being simultaneously
conscious that whatever begins to be, must have a cause,
a reason, for its being. The very validity of our mental acts
is imperilled, if the congruity of the principle of causality be
doubted. Permit an illustration: a minute and beautiful
crystal of unknown nature is before us. By a mental
necessity we know—we cannot free ourselves from the
conviction—that this crystal occupied a measurable time
to become a crystal, and that being such, it occupies a
measurable portion of space. May we rely on this fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
act of mind? Is it truth? If not, there is not a
mental act that ever was, or ever can be, veritable. But if
it be true, then, since for man to produce a physical effect
involves (1) the consciousness of <i>power</i> to do it, and (2) the
volitional exercise of that power; and since the human
mind is absolutely without a trace of knowledge of any
other way in which power can be exercised, in earth or
heaven; is not the insistence of reason that there must be
a cause for cosmic phenomena, a mental act of the <i>same
order</i> as that which insists on time and space as inseverable
factors in the origin and existence of a crystal?</p>

<p>Causality in its mere mechanical relations may be considered
for convenience, and translated as, ‘mechanical
law:’ contemplated in its relation to a living organism, we
may render it by such an expression as a ‘law of life’.
But carry causality to its spring, trace it back to consciousness
and thought, and it admits of no disguise; it is power,
it is volition; there is no halting in its phrase; it is,
‘I can,’ ‘I will.’</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer himself affirms, ‘The force by which we
ourselves produce changes, and which serves to symbolize
the causes of changes in general, is the final disclosure of
analysis.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ‘I can,’ ‘I am able,’ is a knowledge that
emerges within us simultaneously with ‘I am.’ It involves
a consciousness of power, which is the essence of causality.
We possess it, in precisely the same way as we possess ourselves,
or our thoughts. Our knowledge of power is not
even derived from effort or resistance. We know as clearly
what we mean by ‘I am able,’ as we do when we affirm
‘I am here.’ Being able, and <i>knowing</i> we are able, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
absolutely different. A telephone is mechanically able to
transmit vocal sounds and language. But how different to
man, who is not only able, but knows that he is able. This
knowledge of our power to act is the immutable foundation
of our belief in causation.</p>

<p>We may make two separate affirmations: as, for example,
that ‘the thermometer is 6° F. below zero,’ and that
‘water has become solid;’ or, again, we may state, ‘my
fingers rest upon the key-board of an organ,’ and ‘now they
move, and a symphony of Beethoven’s is floating in the air.’
These are ‘sequences;’ but is that enough? No. Instantly
the mental act that <i>interprets</i> them is supplied. In both
cases, our consciousness and reason are compelled to demand
the exercise of power, by means of which one event succeeds
the other. We are absolutely and irresistibly certain, in
the latter case, that it must be so. A direct act of volition
changed the fingers from rest into rhythmic motion, causing
the organ to pour out music; and, by an intellectual necessity,
we see that a diminished temperature, and frozen
water, are not sequences merely; they must be related:
and this conviction is not changed, though, by means of
research, we find their sequential relation to be the result
of the continuity of prior effects; we still retain the unaltered
judgment, that, if we go back far enough, we must
be in the presence of a cause. The mind cannot dispense
with the link of power uniting sequences.</p>

<p>Then, if by long trains of sequential effects and secondary
causes we are led up, not by demonstration, but by irresistible
moral conviction, to a Primordial Power, a source
of all, what is such creative cause? Is it inevitably God?
Is the universe, as we know it, infinite? Who dare say?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Though we know that the vast looming firmament, in which
the ‘milky way’ stretches its depths and winds its awful
amplitudes, is beyond all finite power to follow; yet, it may
be but a complex particle in a universe of universes, stretching
on, and for ever on, over the bourneless immensity of
the unknown.</p>

<p>If that be so, we can make no useful inference from our
finite universe. We could infer only a finite creator from
a finite cosmos. To be finite is to be infinitely less than
infinite; and such a being could not be the ineffable
majesty of mind and might, which we apprehend, but
cannot comprehend, as the Creator.</p>

<p>If such a limited power could be conceived, because it is
finite, it of necessity began to be; and therefore its very
existence was of necessity caused. We seek <i>its</i> cause, as
we do that of all other secondary causes; until at last we
reach the only position in which there is mental rest, an
infinite cause of all causes, the primordial and ultimate
reality of all being.</p>

<p>Concerning even it, the question has arisen, Must not it
also have been caused? Is not this question a paradox?
It is of finite being only that we can affirm the necessity
for causation. What is finite begins to be; what begins
to be, must have been caused to be. But if our moral and
reasoning faculties bring us at last, face to face, with an
inscrutable and infinite primal cause, is there a mental
process exercised by us that demands that such a
being must have had a cause? Experiment cannot
suggest it, for this is neither finite, nor a phenomenon;
and can neither be observed nor analyzed; research in it
is infinitely impossible; and of experience there can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
none. Science is without function in presence of a primal
cause. It is powerless, by virtue of its knowledge or its
methods, to affirm or to deny an infinite and eternal self-existence.
And yet such is not only possible to thought, but
has congruity with all the faculties of reason. The principle
of causality involves merely that every <i>finite</i> existence must
have had a cause for its being; that what is born and dies,
what arises and ceases to be, what began in time and flows
on in continuous mutation, had an originator. But our
consciousness of causality does not and cannot include or
apply to an infinite and unsearchable cause of all. We
may not with our finite plummet seek to measure the
depths of the Infinite, nor with our limited grasp hope to
enfold the All. To say nothing of its cause, what do we
<i>know</i> of even the universe itself? We write and talk
freely of millions of miles, and in a moment reverse the
process and write or speak of millionths of a grain or of an
inch; we think of tens of thousandths of a second, of
millions of years, and duration that is without beginning
and without end. Imagination cannot picture these things,
though thought can possess them. They involve the two
great mysteries ever present to mind, space and time.</p>

<p>Space includes within itself all that can be the subject
of our knowledge, yet it is not a phenomenon, not an entity,
not an object of sensation. It is a pure abstraction. No
space is not thinkable. By no effort of mind can we think
of space as non-existent at any period in infinite duration.
So far as we can see, without objects with their dimensional
relations, space could not be a concept. The contents
of space, out of which the mind abstracts space, are
the source from whence our concept, space, emerges. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
infinite void is mentally nothing; an intellect like man’s,
that had never realized extension in the dimensions of
material bodies, could not present it in thought, any more
than it can conceive correctly the qualities of a fourth
dimension.</p>

<p>In like manner time is not a thing, an entity, to be
accounted for as a creation, a thing caused; it is a
consequence of existences; duration measured by sequences.
If there were no succession of events, there would be no
time. Space and time are mental abstractions, respectively,
of the relations of dimensions and duration.</p>

<p>But with what mystery and majesty, with what proportions
and powers, with what mass and movement is
space full! and of what sequences and phenomena has
time been the unconscious recorder! It is into these that
the mind of man intently peers; it is across the bourneless
area of uncharted space that he would carry his
mental vision; it is into all the vicissitudes that have
arisen, since the succession of cosmic phenomena marked
off a section of duration, that the mind of man is ever
struggling to thread its way; and if possible, to find the
meaning and origin of it all.</p>

<p>That which is the most impressive outcome of all
modern physical investigation, is the apparent mechanical
automatism of all cosmic sequences and phenomena within
our reach. As a result, the most powerful philosophies are
directed to an endeavour to establish a mechanical—that
is, a mindless or purposeless—<i>origin</i> of the universe. But
granted a universe, fully understood, exhaustively known,
purely mechanical in all its <i>present</i> activities; even this,
surely, only makes more absolute the certainty that the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
conditions of its present existence, involved at its beginning,
a more majestic design than all the thinkers of the
past had ever dreamed.</p>

<p>There is no alternative; either chance, or mental purpose,
gave primal origin to all that is. Nothing within the
reach of intellect could express the infinite improbability
of the first suggestion. That <i>one</i> vast harmony, one <i>perfect</i>
method, should fall out by chance, through the operation of
uncounted millenniums of ages, is almost inexpressibly
improbable; but that a system of harmonies, practically
infinite in number and measureless in extent, should all
be locked together in one vast uniting harmony, making
all creation a chorus, to which all its parts from the
centre to the margin contribute their flowing and concerted
strains, without a discord to the unity of thought;
to say that <i>that</i> arose by chance, sprang from fortuity,
fell out by accident, is surely to trifle with the fundamental
principles of our moral faculties and reasoning
powers.</p>

<p>Hence, nothing but philosophical ruin can be the end
of materialism when enunciated in its grosser form. But
our age is distinguished by the existence of a brilliant
philosophical materialism, which has arrested, and is swaying,
the deepest thought of our age, by the opulence of
its learning and resource, by the scientific accuracy and
insight of its abounding and perfect illustrations, and by the
subtile, but stately method and breadth of its generalizations;
but beyond all, by the fact that its world-famed
author, Mr. Herbert Spencer, repels, with warmth, persistence,
and manifest integrity, the very suspicion of
‘materialism’!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Yet we are compelled to ask, of what value, of what
real service, are all the ideal and spiritual assumptions of
his splendid and fascinating philosophy? It acknowledges
a <i>something</i> beyond the matter and the mechanism that fills
the amplitudes of space; it even designates this something
a ‘power,’ But that power is declared, for ever and
infinitely, beyond the circumference of knowledge: it is the
‘absolute,’ the ‘unknowable;’ it can take no part, and
become no agent in, no factor of, any philosophy of the
origin of the universe which we construct. On the very
terms of the philosophy itself, all in heaven and earth,
through all the past and all the future, can be accounted
for and explained without it. If the admission into its
phraseology of the existence of a ‘power,’ which is a
name only, be taken as sufficient reason, then this philosophy
is not materialistic. But if it be remembered that
this ‘power’ is absolutely without function in this philosophy
of the construction of the universe,—if it be true
to its formula,—and that only matter and motion are
asked for, its ultimate materialism is a certainty, and,
from its very subtilty, a peril.</p>

<p>To philosophical Theism the coarser Materialism can
bring no lasting danger. It ignores too much, and assumes
too much; and treats with a too manifest disdain the
fundamental basis of our reasoning faculties.</p>

<p>It has many brilliant exponents; but foremost amongst
them is Haeckel of Jena, a man of large scientific
attainments, a biologist of the highest repute, and possessed
of the keenest acumen. But these are not the only, nor
the essential factors, of a philosophic mind.</p>

<p>He has no hesitancy, no scruple. A Creator for him is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
a conception for scorn, and he pours unceasing contempt
upon the thought that he or any of us are more than
material organisms, alive for our little day and then dead
for ever. There is a future only for the race. The
universe is declared to be without purpose; it is moving
matter, which, by self-operation through immeasurable
duration, has issued in laws that exist without reason, and
devoid of an originator, act, with the deafness of the rock
and the unconsciousness of the sea; producing in the realm
of life the weaker and the stronger, but only for that
unceasing war in which the stronger win.</p>

<p>That for man there is nothing nobler, nothing higher,
than to study the grinding laws which compel him; which
laws are the summaries of natural methods which began
in nothing, and have been for ever vacant of thought or
purpose.</p>

<p>We need have no anxiety concerning the influence of
such a scheme; from its own incoherence it enfolds its
intellectual death-warrant in its very form.</p>

<p>But the philosophy of Spencer is of another order. It
is a philosophy that scorns the idealism of Berkeley, and
that with the fervour of conviction, indignantly repudiates
‘Materialism.’ He contends for the equal and independent
reality of self and not-self, of subject and object, of mind
and matter. He affirms that the ‘co-existence of subject
and object is a deliverance of consciousness.... and is a
truth transcending all others in certainty.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Yet, in the
progress of the philosophy, we discover that from matter in
motion, and nothing else, the whole universe is supposed
to arise; life emerges; and mind, in its most transcendent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
forms comes forth. And it is this fallacy pervading the
philosophy that is the essence of its power. Repudiating
‘Materialism’ as philosophically untenable, it yet exists as
a philosophy to endeavour to show that mind is an outcome
of matter.</p>

<p>Look at the problem it sets for solution. ‘Philosophy,’
says Spencer, ‘is <i>completely unified</i> knowledge;’ and adds,
‘... a philosophy stands self-convicted of inadequacy, if
it does not formulate the whole series of changes passed
through by every existence.... If it begins its explanations
with existences that already have concrete forms ...
then manifestly they had preceding histories ... of which
no account is given. And as such preceding ... histories
are subjects of possible knowledge, a philosophy which says
nothing about them falls short of the required unification.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Then, on the very terms of the philosophy, we are to
contemplate ‘the beginning’ with absolutely nothing
anterior or unaccounted for. There must be no ‘concrete
forms,’ no ‘preceding histories,’ to be encountered.</p>

<p>Now observe, it is clearly recognised in this philosophy
that the ultimate nature of all that constitutes the universe
is infinitely beyond the reach of the human mind; that in
their final nature time, space, matter, motion, rest, the
transfer of motion, the exercise of force, the nature and
operation of consciousness and thought, are all equally, that
is, infinitely, inscrutable. Knowledge is inexorably limited
to, and co-extensive with, phenomena; yet from these
phenomena alone we are to obtain exhaustive accounts of
their own origin and existence, in spite of the admitted
inscrutable mysteries of which they are the manifestations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>If we can obtain so complete a knowledge of matter and
motion, by a scientific study of them, as will enable us, with
that knowledge alone, to explain their origin and account
for the sequences they involve, then there is no more
mystery. There are no ‘ultimates’ to explain. Our
knowledge covers all that is, in space and time. The
‘Absolute’ itself is a meaningless superfluity, and the
mysterious ‘power’ that is philosophically invoked can
have no true place, for all is explicable without it.</p>

<p>A beginning is inevitable to a philosophy of material
evolution. Then ‘in the beginning’ what? How in the
zero, in which there were no ‘concrete forms’ and no
‘preceding histories,’ did the first movement towards the
plenished arch of heaven and the fruitful earth arise?
Concentration and diffusion, it is affirmed, are universally
observed physical processes. The latest science in tracing
back the genealogies of various objects finds that ‘their
components were once in diffused states, and, pursuing
their histories forwards, finds diffused states will be again
assumed by them.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Clearly, then, ‘matter’ is assumed to
exist at the ‘beginning.’ It certainly <i>may</i> have had a
‘preceding history;’ and to ignore this is to come, at the
outset, perilously near to a philosophy ‘that stands self-convicted
of inadequacy.’</p>

<p>A diffused state of matter is, it thus appears, the earliest
point of the beginning that physical evolution can descry.
This is the nebular hypothesis of Laplace; without doubt a
majestic theory, but a theory still. Science has welcomed
it to work with; and it explains, or aids in the interpretation
of, much; but, that it should be taken so for granted as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
to be considered a demonstrated or even undisputed and
established fact of modern science, we may be permitted to
doubt; and it must have had a ‘preceding history.’ It
takes us to a point in measureless past duration, where all
that is now concrete matter is assumed to have been in a
gaseous state. It is not even contended that it is an
original condition. Such an almost infinite mass of
nebulous matter must have been due, if existent, to heat,
and to heat of an intensity that defies our range of
conception.</p>

<p>But whence did such heat come? ‘Heat’ is demonstrated
to us now as a rhythmic ‘mode of motion;’ one of
the phenomena of nature to be accounted for. Verily, heat
is a phenomenon with a ‘preceding history,’ and yet at the
outset its presence is assumed in the cosmic cloud.</p>

<p>But, further complexity still, how does heat act in this
primordial nebula? If heat is a ‘mode of motion,’ by
what were the heat vibrations wrought? You must have
<i>then</i>, for the phenomenon of heat, what is indispensable to
the physical theory of it now:—the inconceivable but indispensable
ether of modern physics. But how came the
ether in, and beyond, the cosmic cloud? It is an ‘existence,’
manifestly; more, it is ‘matter;’ but matter that transcends
the range of the action of gravity; it is without weight, and
differentiated from all matter that we know in a manner
that thought cannot follow.</p>

<p>How did this ‘existence’ pass from the imperceptible to
the perceptible? and by its own requirement should not a
complete philosophy furnish its past history?</p>

<p>Let us come more closely into contact with the actual
formula of this philosophy. ‘Evolution,’ says Spencer, ‘is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
an integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of
motion, during which the matter passes from an indefinite,
incoherent homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity,
and during which the retained motion undergoes a parallel
transformation.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, are the factors of the potential universe. By
definition they are the sole structural essentials. Beyond
them nothing should be asked, required, or assumed. What
are these irreducible factors of the formula? ‘Matter’ and
‘motion.’ But we have clearly seen that we are cognizant
of matter as such only by its ‘modes of motion’. It is
<i>these</i> for which evolution has to account. ‘Matter’ denuded
of the qualities by which we now are cognizant of it, can be
no other than dimensions without qualities, spatial presence
undiscoverable by sense.</p>

<p>On the other hand, pure motion, motion by itself, is
impossible to thought. Motion is only known as an
affection of matter. ‘It becomes manifest,’ says Spencer,
‘that our experience of <i>force</i> is that out of which our idea
of matter is built’.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But, in the terms of the formula, force
can be nothing but matter affected by motion. What, then,
was this primary matter on which motion first acted, and
before motion had by various ‘modes’ produced in it a
single quality? No answer is possible; but, nevertheless,
as the philosophy unfolds itself we find that ‘we need not
refrain ... from dealing with matter as made up of
extended and resistant atoms,’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and henceforth we are led
to consider the cosmic nebula as not only homogeneous, but
as being, in its homogeneity, atomic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>No lover of physical and chemical science can do other
than profoundly admire the atomic theory of modern
physics. But there is no sound physicist or chemist but
is sufficiently alive to its difficulties to know that in every
form in which it has been presented, it is, to say no more,
tentative and hypothetic. In Mr. Spencer’s philosophy it
becomes a fundamental fact of the beginning. But the
existence of atoms being granted, how did they arise?
‘If you ask the materialist,’ says Professor Tyndall,
‘whence is this matter ... who or what divided it into
molecules ... he has no answer.’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> So that here, in
spite of the claim made, no philosophy can be ‘complete;’
and even the doctrine of an eternally automatic evolution
is philosophically inadequate.</p>

<p>But these atoms of the primordial haze are ‘resistant;’
such a quality can only result from a special affection of
matter by motion; whence came or how arose such an
affection of matter? Its existence in the atoms of the
nebula inevitably implies ‘preceding history,’ but it is not
given; and this pregnant atomic haze is, so far as we can
see, without colour, without chemical affinity or reaction,
without light, electricity, or magnetism, and devoid of all
cohesion.</p>

<p>Clearly, these are not the atoms of the chemical elements
known to us. They are not the atoms of Dalton nor of Clark
Maxwell. The atoms of the cosmic mist are, by the very terms
of the formula, naked of quality; and, by the limiting conditions
of the definition of the cloud as homogeneous, are,
throughout all the abysms of space, alike in size, in shape, and
in motions. Equal extensions of space moving at equal rates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>By these conditions, then, it is manifest that primordial
matter is in itself infinitely powerless and inert. Motion
can affect it; but can there be motion of any <i>new</i> kind
originated without a power to cause it? If that can be,
the fundamental acts of human reason are untrustworthy;
and man is incapable of knowledge or deduction, which is
absurd. Then what was the power that determined new
motions in the primordial homogeneous matter?</p>

<p>It could not by any demand in the formula be even
gravity, if that were competent. Modern thought and
knowledge cannot allow gravitation to be a property of
matter. Ether is matter, but it does not gravitate.
Gravity is therefore an occult affection of matter by
motion, that has a history ‘to be accounted for.’</p>

<p>In this almost infinite primal nebula, a certain class of
motion is assumed. How it originated is unexplained. But
what is the atomic motion of this primal homogeneous matter?
From the terms given it must be as I have said. Motion
of absolute likeness throughout all the profounds of space it
filled; equalized motion in every atom; no difference of rate;
no difference of mode. The motion of one atom is identic
with the motion of all. It could never be lost; it could
never increase; it could never alter. It is homogeneous,
and <i>therefore</i> changeless—balanced for ever—in itself. Says
Mr. Spencer: ‘Any finite mass of diffused matter, even
though vast enough to form our whole sidereal system,’ if
it were of ‘absolute sphericity, absolute uniformity of
composition, and absolute symmetry of relation to all
forces external to it,’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> would be homogeneous and eternally
incapable of change.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>And that ‘homogeneity’ is the very condition laid down
for the beginning, from which mechanical evolution is to
educe the universe. In the Spencerian formula there is
no qualification of the term homogeneous. It postulates
‘an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity,’ that is, an indefinite
cloud, with balanced motion in all its atoms which
neither attracts nor repels, and is in itself infinitely incapable
of change.</p>

<p>Now, shall we not ask <i>how</i> the first pulse, that caused
the stupendously vast homogeneity to throb into the
heterogeneous, arose? whence did it come? Infinite incapacity
could not, unless reason be mendacious, render
<i>itself</i> capable. Then how came that <i>first</i> movement that, it
is argued, ended in revolving systems, a bountiful earth,
the throat of the nightingale, and the tragedy of Macbeth!</p>

<p>There is no answer. This philosophy, to get the first
progressive movement in its balanced nebula, bids its
formula stand aside, that it may advance. At a critical
moment it changes the very meaning of the homogeneous.
‘The condition of homogeneity is a condition of unstable
equilibrium!’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> ‘The phrase ... is one used in
mechanics to express a balance of forces of such kind that
the interference of any further force, however minute, will
destroy the arrangement previously subsisting, and bring
about a totally different arrangement.’<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Note, then, the homogeneous cosmic cloud is, by the
terms given, in equilibrium. But some ‘further force,’
some small influence <i>outside</i> itself, acts upon it, and it
breaks up.</p>

<p>But what is the <i>outside</i> influence? What is this ‘further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
force,’ and from whence? We have a cloud composed
of atoms in balanced motion—nothing more. Outside
influence, ‘further force,’ is an intrusion. It has no right
there. It has not on the wedding garment of the formula.</p>

<p>Surely an outside influence must be caused? If it
involved no more energy than is wielded by a may-fly’s
wing, how came it there? It is as easy to admit the
<i>self-origination</i> of a divinity of power, as the <i>self-creation</i> of
power to lift a grain. It is not in the philosophy; ‘outside
influence’ has no credentials, and the admission of
inability to evolve the universe without it, is an admission
that the mechanical philosophy fails at the outset.
Nor can it serve the emergency to invoke ‘force.’</p>

<p>A Divine origin of the universe is usually rejected,
because the Divinity eludes the methods of science. But
we cannot supplant the Deity by enthroning force. Science
can tell us what force <i>does</i>, but it can no more find what
force <i>is</i>, than what an infinite mind is. Force is an
irresistible mental inference from matter in motion, but its
ultimate nature is defiantly beyond the reach of science.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that to obtain even the ‘elements’ of
our modern chemistry, the philosophy of mechanical
evolution must, at the beginning, call in uncovenanted aid.
Let us remember this, while for the purposes of argument
we allow it. There may have been secured, added, and
perhaps altered, motion by the surreptitious ‘outside influence;’
but it can be nothing more. The atoms are still
without property, and are only affected by motion. Have
we any <i>experience</i> to induce us to believe that atoms
without property, even affected by thermal vibrations and
pushed by gravity, will build themselves up into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
seventy ‘elements’ of chemistry with their specific and
inalienable qualities? That, through vibrations of heat
and pushings of gravity, they could become hydrogen and
mercury, carbon and gold, chlorine and phosphorus! And
these properties being thus acquired, by their sheer interactions
that all the chemistry, the physics, and the <i>order</i>
of all the area of space within the galaxy arose? This
is what the formula of the most brilliant philosophy of any
age would lead us to infer.</p>

<p>In this relation I do not forget the recent and splendid
service done by Mr. Crooks to the philosophical side of
chemistry in the record of his researches on ‘The Genesis
of the Elements.’ It is a most subtile and exquisite means
of endeavouring to deduce the <i>method</i>, the ‘<i>law</i>’ according
to which what we know as the ‘chemical elements’ were
built up. He obtains indications of a primitive element—a
something out of which the elements were evolved.
He calls it <i>protyle</i> or first stuff, and from its presence
he concludes that the elements, as we know them, ‘are
not simple and primordial, that they have not arisen by
chance, or been created in a desultory and mechanical
manner, but have been evolved from simpler matter—or
perhaps indeed from one sole kind of matter.’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>But this reduction of matter, as we know it, to a simpler
but still highly differentiated condition, only causes reason
the more earnestly to demand how the rhythmic and complex
method, which we express by the word ‘law,’ came
into operation, and was established for ever.</p>

<p>The ‘protyle’ is infinitely more complex than the
atoms of the homogeneous nebula. It makes no philosophical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
difference whether the ultimate atoms of the bodies
known as elementary are all alike, or in each instance
special. In either case there is infinitely more in the
matter they severally make, than can be deduced from
motion affecting the primitive atoms.</p>

<p>But not only have we by the formula and constructive
method of this philosophy to obtain protyle from the mere
effects of motion on primitive atoms; but, by the same
means alone, we have to change protyle into the seventy
‘elements;’ above all, without an added factor or a change
in the method, we have to rise to life!</p>

<p>Let us reflect. By life in this relation is meant that
which lives, an organism endowed with life’s properties.
Are these properties unique? Or is there some point of
fluxion where the properties of life at their minima
arise in the activities of not-life at some undiscovered
maxima? A point at which some occult molecular complexities
arise, changing matter dead into matter living?</p>

<p>The answer must come, not through our abstract logic,
but from our laboratories.</p>

<p>Life, it is well known, has its phenomena inherent in,
and strictly confined to, a highly complex compound, with
fixed chemical constituents. This compound, in its living
state, is known as protoplasm. It is clear, colourless, and,
to our finest optical resources, devoid of discoverable structure.
There is not a living thing on earth but possesses
its life in protoplasm, from a microscopic fungus to man.</p>

<p>To depict the properties of life in irreducible simplicity,
take one of the lowliest instances within the present range
of science. Let it be one of the exquisitely minute, almost
infinitely prolific, and universally diffused living forms that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
set up and carry on putrefaction. The lesser of them may,
when considered as solid specks, vary from the fifty thousand
millionth of a cubic inch to the twenty billionth of a cubic
inch. I select one that is oval in shape. It moves with
the agility of the grayling and the grace of a swallow, the
motion resulting from the rhythmic action of two motile
fibres.</p>

<p>This free and self-originating action is its first vital
quality.</p>

<p>Its mission as an organism, is to break up and set free
the chemical elements that had been locked up in dead
organic compounds. Its own substance wears out by this
and other means; and it has the power to renovate the
waste from the dead decomposition in which it lives; constructing,
in the laboratory of its protoplasm, new living
matter.</p>

<p>This is the second characteristic of that alone which
lives. By it, living matter is <i>sui generis</i>. Every instant,
and at the same temperature, this inconceivably minute
speck, without discoverable structure, effects analyses and
complicated syntheses which either baffle all the synthetic
chemistry of man, or else, where he is able to accomplish
the simplest of the organic syntheses, it is by processes and
at temperatures that make all life impossible.</p>

<p>But more, this vital and inconceivably minute speck
multiplies with astounding rapidity in two ways; by the
first and common process, in the course of a minute and a
half the entire body is divided into two precisely similar
bodies, each one being perfect; almost immediately these
again divide, and so on in geometric ratio through all the
populated fluid; the rapidity of this intense and wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
vital action transcending all thought. By this process
alone a single form may in three hours give rise to a
population of organisms as great as the human population
of the globe.</p>

<p>But this is not all; at certain stages of the organism
self-division ceases. The final divisions result in strikingly
modified forms of the organism; these approach each other
and melt together. They are then shining globules without
action, but at the end of a given time they open, and
pour out a continuous cloud of minutest spore or ova, which
are as countless as the sands; and from these arise again
another host of the organisms, which pass again through
all the mystery and marvel of this vital cycle.</p>

<p>And this is the third of the qualities that make what
lives absolutely unique amidst the things of earth.</p>

<p>This is life—whether vegetable or animal none can
determine—in the simplest form in which it can be
known; life that is possessed only of the irreducible
properties which are inalienable, and which distinguish it
for ever and everywhere from what is not-life.</p>

<p>It is true that the philosopher, by the common consent
of mind, occupies the throne of intellect; but it is not, for
all that, to the esoteric philosopher, not to the deep mental
seer, who girdles all space, all duration, all phenomena with
his thought, that nature reveals her latest, her subtlest, her
profoundest secrets. It is to the patient student—nature’s
loving learner, whose eye and ear are trained to read her
faintest writing and catch her lowest whisper—that her
deepest truths in all their strength and immediate bearing
are disclosed. Yet the fates of philosophies are determined
by these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Then what is the testimony of students and searchers as
to the mode in which life takes its origin to-day? Does
life originate <i>in</i> life? or do we find that in our laboratories,
and in the observed processes of nature <i>now</i>, the not-living
can be, without the intervention of living things, changed
into that which lives?</p>

<p>Biology, as a science, answers ‘no.’ Says the greatest
master of all the facts, Professor Huxley: ‘The properties
of living matter distinguish it absolutely from all other
kinds of things, and,’ he continues, ‘the present state of our
knowledge furnishes us with no link between the living
and the not-living.’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Then what lives is, in its qualities, utterly unlike—sharply
marked off from—what is not living. Yet the
elements that make up the living stuff are the most
common on the earth. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen:
we know them each and all; we know their properties and
reactions on each other, and on all the minor elements of
the living matter; but that knowledge only complicates the
nature of the problem. The mystery of life is, not that
any occult elements compose the matter in which it dwells;
the mystery of life consists solely in the question, <i>how</i> the
elements that make up protoplasm can be so combined, as,
by their combination, to acquire the splendid and solitary
properties of that which lives.</p>

<p>Manifestly, then, there was a time in the past history of
the globe, when its matter was without life, and therefore
there must have been a time, perhaps at a point of intense
activity in the not-living matter of the globe, when it
became endowed with the properties of life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>By what agency that transcendent upward movement
was wrought, science claims no vocation to inquire. But
let the earth, and air, and sea, with all their teeming
denizens, attest,—that power was competent.</p>

<p>Now let us ask, can we as rational beings account for
all the properties of living things in terms of matter and
motion? Will vibrating atoms, with millenniums of ages
to work in, but no power to direct them, explain the
wonder? Was the transmutation of not-living matter into
living brought about merely by what we can reduce to solid
geometry and transcendental numbers? atoms, which we can
approximately measure, dancing to the rhythm of complex
motion?</p>

<p>All that mechanical evolution has to work with, is atoms
and motions. Pile the atoms into complexities too large
for clear thought, cluster molecule round molecule, and let
them beat in multitudinous harmonies defiant of conception,
yet all you have is matter in motion. It is not life with
its sentiency; it is not life with its self-chosen movement;
it is not life with its power to construct its own substance
out of matter that is dead, and to multiply its kind <i>ad
libitum</i>.</p>

<p>And yet Mr. Spencer begins by taking what no mental
manipulation of the naked formula of his philosophy could
provide, the ‘elements’ of our present chemistry; and by
imagining higher and higher complexities of atomic structure
a complicated molecule is reached; and then, by a change
in name, which is justified by no change in the facts, he
calls the complex substance organic matter; and by simply
continuing this process, thinks he sees it become living.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>The justification of all this is the affirmation ‘that organic
matter was not produced all at once,’ and that there is in
the laboratory of the chemist ‘what we may literally call
artificial evolution.’ Mr. Spencer instances a laboratory
product of what is counted a sufficiently typical organic
compound.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But to obtain it the chemist has to employ
no less than twenty distinct chemical and physical processes,
involving many varying temperatures, from a red
heat to the intensity of the electric arc, and between thirty
and forty reagents and their products, are employed in the
process. Compare this with the silent and impenetrable
simplicity of the chemistry of life, and vivid and striking
is the contrast. And yet when this product of the chemist
lies before you, produced by the tremendous relative labours
of the laboratory, it is as far off from dead white of egg, to
say nothing of living protoplasm, as the qualities of a flint
pebble are from the qualities of the diamond.</p>

<p>The <i>facts</i> of nature—surely our safest guide—declare
that the transition from not-life to life is abrupt. The break
is absolute and clear. A ‘complex molecule’ is a molecule
of atoms in motion,—nothing more. More atoms and
more motion cannot, by themselves, as Mr. Spencer would
teach, make it ‘organic;’ much less can any further addition
of atoms and tremors make it live. It is in vain for
Haeckel to call the simplest moneron that lives ‘primeval
slime,’ or to call numbers of them ‘individualized lumps of
albumen.’ It is a travesty. Under the same lens place
‘a lump of albumen’ and the lowest <i>living</i> infusorian, and
a voiceless contradiction of Haeckel’s phrase which none
can ever question is indubitably given. The infusorian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
lives; the albumen is dead. The infusorian constructs the
vital matter of its own body from the heterogeneous matter
in which it lives; the albumen decomposes as it lies there.
The infusorian has soon multiplied by millions, while the
albumen disappears by decadence. To write of living
monera as ‘albumen,’ or of ‘complex molecules’ with
nothing more than their complexity, as <i>living</i>, is to
contradict, in the name, the essential and distinguishing
qualities of both.</p>

<p>This impropriety may be yet more manifest by another
quotation from Haeckel. His aim is to endeavour by the
use of vague language to reduce the impassable gulf
between the living and the not-living, and he writes of the
animal <i>ovum</i>, as ‘a little lump of albumen in which another
albuminous body is enclosed—the nucleus.’ What profound
trifling is this! Think of, say a human ovum, an
invisible particle less than the hundredth of an inch in
diameter; it <i>lives</i>; and there lies coiled up in the mystery
of its minuteness all the potentiality of the highest manhood;
all the possible power of Socrates, or Homer, or Goethe.
Is that simply ‘a lump of albumen’? Not unless a man
can be justly described as such, by the bottles of chemical
substances to which his body can be reduced.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Spencer pleads that ‘the lowest living things
are not, properly speaking, organisms at all, for they have
no distinctions of parts, no traces of organization.’ If it
were true that our lenses cannot reveal organization in the
lowliest and smallest organisms, does it follow that there <i>is</i>
none? Will Mr. Spencer risk the validity of the doctrine
of material atoms on the ability of our lenses to show the
atom? Surely not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>But the affirmation is not supported by facts. The
splendid increase of microscopical lens power during the
past decade has not only enabled us to see that there is
complexity and structure in both the animal and vegetable
cell, which bisects by an elaborate process; but even the
minute nucleus of the minutest organisms, often not more
than one tenth part of the infinitesimal body itself, is now
proved to undergo profound structural changes, which precede
all the great cyclic changes of the organism as a
whole. The nucleus is the centre, in fact, of all the
higher activities of the least and lowest infusoria; and is
the centre of most delicate but clearly demonstrable
structural changes.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>We cannot reduce the mystery of life by treating contemptuously
its ultimate cells. They are as defiant of
interpretation by our present methods as the more complex
structures they compose. The mystery of life, <i>per se</i>, is as
great and as deep, in a monad and a mildew, as in a man.
Every attempt to argue away the meaning of vital function
and property, on the basis of the organic simplicity of unicellular
organisms, is wholly fallacious. It is knowledge,
not speculation, which affirms that the least and lowest, as
well as the largest and most complex of living forms, are
distinguished absolutely from all other kinds of things.
There is ‘no link’ between matter living and matter without
life. To attempt to build up ‘life’ by slow increments
of added complexity, in atomic or molecular structure, is a
philosophical ingenuity; but it expresses no natural truth
within the horizon of our knowledge. A higher number
of primal, or even chemical atoms, arranged in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
complex ratios, and affected by the most rhythmic movements,
are not the data from which to deduce a living
organism. And to affirm of the lowest living things that
‘they are not, properly speaking, organisms at all,’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> because
the instruments used at a given date did not reveal structure,
is, at best, an <i>argumentum a silentio</i>; while simultaneously
it contradicts the facts of biology, and assumes the whole
point at issue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is not a single fact within the
present range of our knowledge that indicates, or even
suggests, that the quarternary compounds approximate,
under any known conditions, to the state of matter living.</p>

<p>As the sheets of this Lecture are passing through the
press, Sir Henry Roscoe, as President of the British
Association, has delivered a brilliant and essentially
scientific address. On the subject of chemistry none can
speak with a voice more authoritative: and on this very
question he writes as follows: ‘But now the question
may well be put—Is any limit set to this synthetic power
of the chemist? Although the danger of dogmatizing as
to the progress of science has already been shown in too
many instances, yet one cannot help feeling that the barrier
which exists between the organized and unorganized worlds
is one which the chemist sees no chance of breaking down.
It is true that there are those who profess to foresee that
the day will arrive, when the chemist, by a succession of
constructive efforts, may pass beyond albumen, and gather
the elements of lifeless matter into a living structure.
Whatever may be said regarding this from other standpoints,
the chemist can only say that at present no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
problem lies within his province. Protoplasm, with which
the simplest manifestations of life are associated, is not a
compound, but a structure built up of compounds. The
chemist may successfully synthesize any of its component
molecules, but he has no more reason to look forward to
the synthetic production of the structure than to imagine
that the synthesis of gallic acid leads to the artificial
production of gall-nuts.’<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>To assume, then, that by starting with atoms in equilibriated
motions, uncounted millenniums of ages ago, and that
by adding atoms and groups of atoms, with altered and re-altered
motions as the ages roll away, with the result that
at last, with these factors and no others, we shall get
organism and life, is, surely, as fallacious as to explain
Millais’s picture of the Huguenots as having been brought
about by a skilful arrangement of palettes and brushes,
easels and pigments.</p>

<p>Now let it be clearly recalled that Charles Darwin
involved himself in none of this philosophic ambiguity.
To him life was more than a complexity of elementary
atoms affected by motion. It was something he could
not ‘explain.’ He postulated, therefore, the unexplained
presence of ‘primordial living germs,’ endowed with the
properties, which, experience teaches, are possessed by living
matter to-day.</p>

<p>How, in the great past, mineral and gaseous matters
on this earth were, as a question of scientific method,
so affected as to become living matter is, to our present
resources at least, impenetrable.

<p>I merely contend that whatever were the means by
which dead matter first lived, they were higher, infinitely
higher, than matter and motion; they could only have been
the resources of a <i>competent</i> power.</p>

<p>I adopt gladly the language of Professor Huxley: ‘Belief,
in the scientific sense of the word,’ he says, ‘is a serious
matter, and needs strong foundations. To say, therefore,
in the admitted absence of evidence, that I have any belief
as to the mode in which existing forms of life have
originated, would be using words in a wrong sense. But
expectation is permissible where belief is not; and if it
were given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically
recorded time to the still more remote period when the
earth was passing through physical and chemical conditions,
which it can no more see again than a man can recall his
infancy, I should expect to be a witness of the evolution of
living protoplasm from not-Living matter.’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> So should I.</p>

<p>By what other means than by the operation of natural
‘laws’ can we think of the Infinite Power, extending
through all extent, as the fountain of all being, as acting?
Every process of nature that ever man has investigated
throughout all space and all time, results from a perfect and
unalterable method which we call a ‘law’ of nature. Then
why should the primal process, by which not-living matter
became, once for all, living, be brought about by any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
means than the predetermined action of competent natural
laws? Because life—living matter—does not <i>now</i> arise
directly from that which is not-life, does it follow that the
creative method was discontinuous? that the primordial
creative laws willed into operation ‘in the beginning’ were
only competent to evolve the inorganic and not-living? and
that at this point a supernatural ‘interference,’ a ‘miraculous
interposition,’ had to be effected to endow what was
dead with the transcendent properties of life? The whole
line of human experience, interpreted in the light of modern
scientific knowledge, compels the conclusion that the
‘primordial germs’ in which life on earth began, arose by
the operation of natural creative laws. That an energy,
not now operating within the area of our experience, was at
work, when not-living matter progressed into living structure,
is certain. But there is nothing, within the range of our
knowledge, that permits the inference that it was brought
about by any other means, than such as, if we could have
seen them in operation, we should have called ‘laws’ of
nature. This view surely ennobles without limit our fatally
humanized view of creative action. ‘The beginning’ was
thus, by the unsearchable mystery of a creative mind and
will, the <i>potentiality</i> of all the universe through all its
duration; which it only required ‘time’ in which the
potential powers and modes should operate, to make actual,
in the universe we see.</p>

<p>As the highest mental powers and products of the most
gifted of our race, were originally potential in the
primitive ovum from which each took his origin, so, it is
congruous, and capable of being grasped by our thought
although it cannot be portrayed by our imagination, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the mind and will of the inscrutable Creator prevised and
preordered the whole series of conditions which, by their
immutable action, interaction, and rhythmic concurrence
as ‘laws,’ evolved the universe.</p>

<p>So far as the finest and keenest researches in chemistry
and physics carry us, especially such researches as those of
Crooks and Lockyer, it is powerfully indicated that the
creative method in the inorganic world was a sublime progressive
plan, a building up by law, of the dome of heaven
and the floor of earth, and all that goes with both. But
behind the matter and the motion, above the energies and
the force, there surely was, as we have been constrained to
see, what we can only think of as the conception, the purpose,
and the will by which the evolving order, marked in
high, and higher sublimity, the upward and onward movement
of the ripening and uncounted ages.</p>

<p>But when the highest point of the inorganic, the not-living,
was reached, and a new factor had to appear in
the world to crown some of its matter with <i>life</i> and all its
wonders, what was it that ensued? If ‘law’ did not cease
to act; if there were no break in the continuity of evolution,
and yet a factor of power, not now operating within the
range of our knowledge, was absolutely necessary to change
the not-living matter of the earth into matter that lived,
how was it brought about?</p>

<p>Our inability to reply, does not invalidate the facts on
the one hand, nor justify attempts at explanations that find
no sanction in experience and knowledge on the other.</p>

<p>Suggestion by analogy, feeble as it is, is the nearest
approach that we can make to the solution of what must,
perhaps, remain for ever a splendid mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>If creation be, then, the expression of the mind and will
of a Creator, uttered in method and issuing in phenomena,
he must see the end from the beginning: his resource is
infinite. The human mathematician, of the highest order,
can devise, with all the adaptations and prearrangements
that are needed, an instrument or machine, which shall
continue for a number of motions, without necessary limit,
according to a primal law, but which by such prevised and
preordered arrangements would, suddenly, at the required
point of time, undergo change, and operate henceforth after
a law entirely new.</p>

<p>An instrument has actually been made which was competent
to effect the solution of quadratic equations whose
roots are real. One has also been made capable of effecting
the determination of the real roots of any equation. It is
perfectly conceivable that an instrument could be made
which should go on finding the real roots only, for a
measured time, and then by a prearranged and provided
method should suddenly, by the very laws and principles
of its construction, so change, that for another period, or for
evermore, it should also determine the imaginary roots.</p>

<p>Is it not conceivable that infinite resource, infinite wisdom,
infinite prevision and power could in a manner which this
illustration only suggests have caused the non-vital universe
to become in some parts vital? Could not infinite power,
infinite wisdom, the originator of all that we call material
phenomena, have prevised and preordered, in the impenetrable
mystery of ‘the beginning,’ that the creative laws of
evolution for an inorganic world, should, as they brought
about the completion of their perfect purpose, have carried
with them from that ‘beginning’ preordered potentialities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
that should, by the primal volition of the Creator, emerge,
as an inevitable and orderly sequence, into the operation of
higher activities and new laws?</p>

<p>If that may not be, it is not a divine being that is in
our thought. But if that may be, then the self-acting laws
of nature are self-acting, as the products of eternal mind
and will. Each self-acting phenomenon is, to us, an
embodied thought of God; emerging in matter now, as a
consequence of the sublimity and perfection of the methods
divinely willed ‘in the beginning.’</p>

<p>Let this illustration weigh for what it will; this at
least is clear, that the mechanical philosophy, whether or
not it refuses to be called ‘material,’ has proved its formula
incompetent. Atomic matter without property, affected by
motion, with persistent relations between the matter and
the motion, can no more account for the universe even up
to the point of the origin of the lowest life, than the
vibrations of a musical chord can account for the joy
begotten of music.</p>

<p>But how stands the problem of its origin, when, in that
which lives, we include the presence of mind? None more
firmly contends for the absolute disparity, the entire and
unqualified difference between mind and matter, than Mr.
Spencer. To him there can be nothing within the whole
realm of thought severed by a wider interval than consciousness
and thought on the one hand, and matter on the
other. ‘Just,’ he says, ‘in the same way that the object is
the unknown permanent <i>nexus</i> which is never itself a
phenomenon, but is that which holds phenomena together,
so is the subject the unknown permanent <i>nexus</i> which is
never itself a state of consciousness, but which holds all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
states of consciousness together.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Mind and matter, then,
are here admitted to be infinitely unlike, but absolutely
equal realities. This is boldly reaffirmed; he says: ‘No
effort of imagination enables us to think of a shock, however
minute, except as undergone by an entity. We are
compelled, therefore, to postulate a substance of mind that
is affected, before we can think of its affections.’<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>This is as clear as a geometric definition. Mind and
matter are admitted to be the two opposite termini of
thought; they are divided by an interval beyond which
thought cannot go. They are symbolized as <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, two
equally unknown, but absolutely unlike, quantities. Beyond
the common fact of existence, there is not a quality of the
one that is not infinitely unlike all the qualities of the
other.</p>

<p>What this disparity is we all know: enough, that matter
is inert, absolutely without perceiving power, and unable in
itself to move or to produce motion. But mind is conscious,
knows that it exists; and, however mysteriously, originates
motion. Matter has mass; mind is absolutely without it.
Matter cannot be thought of save as an occupant of space.
Mind has no extension.</p>

<p>Is it conceivable, then, that we should be required by
this philosophy, which thus admits the utter disparity of
mind and matter, to make mind a function of matter?
that we should be asked to mentally follow a process by
which <i>y</i> shall be changed into <i>x</i>? This verily is so!</p>

<p>I must repeat the formula of this philosophy of
evolution. ‘Evolution is an integration of matter, and
concomitant dissipation of motion, during which the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
passes from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity to a
definite, coherent heterogeneity, and during which the
retained motion undergoes a parallel transformation.’</p>

<p>Matter and motion, these are the all; no suggestion of
aught besides. Then, if on that formula the philosophy is
built, the rhythmic vicissitudes through which matter has
passed during limitless millenniums of time, are supposed to
be able to change matter’s unconsciousness into self-perception
and thought; to cause extended and gravitating mass
to pass into an unextended realization of its own being,
unyoked to gravity; to emerge from space relations
involving motion produced by outside forces, to an
absolute independence of space relations which makes
motion impossible. If we make our <i>knowledge</i> of phenomena
and the processes and methods of Nature the basis
of our judgment, is it not manifest, that such a change is
incapable of being thought?</p>

<p>The unknown <i>y</i>, that is, matter, must, by sheer physical
vicissitudes, actually abnegate its own qualities, and emerge,
no longer <i>itself</i>, <i>y</i>, but another entity, infinitely unlike
itself, that is, <i>x</i>!</p>

<p>If mind and matter are divergent from each other by
infinite unlikeness of quality, the mind refuses assent, that
any process, based on the foundation of accurate human
knowledge, would sanction the emergence of mind by
physical processes from matter. Mind is the antithesis,
and cannot be a function, of matter.</p>

<p>The mind is intimately linked with cerebral action. We do
not know mind apart from brain; but there is no discovered
correlation between the <i>work</i> of the brain, and consciousness.
Dr. Tyndall, whose keen and instructed intellect has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
addressed itself to this deep problem from the position of a
physicist, says, amongst many similar utterances: ‘But
when we endeavour to pass ... from the phenomena of
physics to those of thought, we meet a problem which
transcends any conceivable expansion of the powers which
we now possess. We may think over the subject again
and again, but it eludes all intellectual presentation. We
stand at length face to face with the incomprehensible.
The territory of physics is wide, but it has its limits, from
which we look with vacant gaze into the region beyond,
... and thus it will ever loom, compelling the philosophies
of successive ages to confess that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“We are such stuff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As dreams are made of, and our life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is rounded by a sleep.”’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same thinker asks, ‘What is the causal connexion
... between molecular motions and states of consciousness?’
And he answers that neither he nor any other
can know; and adds: ‘It is no explanation to say that the
objective and subjective are two sides of one and the same
phenomenon. Why should the phenomenon have two
sides? This is the very core of the difficulty. There are
plenty of molecular motions which do not exhibit this two-sidedness.
Does water think or feel when it runs into
frost ferns upon a window pane? If not, why should the
molecular motion of the brain be yoked to this mysterious
companion—consciousness?’<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Says Professor Tait, one of our most distinguished
physicists: ‘There are ... things associated with living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
beings which, of course, no one in his senses can regard as
physical. Even such things as consciousness and volition
we have absolutely no reason, however vague, for classifying
even in the smallest degree under the head of physics.’<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>‘I,’ writes Professor Huxley, ‘know nothing whatever,
and never hope to know anything, of the steps by which
the passage from molecular movement to states of consciousness
is effected.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And again, ‘All our knowledge is
a knowledge of states of consciousness. “Matter” and
“force” are, so far as we can know, mere names for
certain forms of consciousness.‘<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Such disparity is there, then, between matter and mind,
that it would be apparently as congruous to conceive of a
thought as solidifying itself into a material object, as to
conceive of any affection of material molecules as being the
sole cause of thought. Hence, it follows that the Spencerian
philosophy, which affirms the absolute distinctness of mind
from matter, on the one hand; but, having no other
structural elements <i>than</i> matter in motion, on the other
hand, seeks to educe mind from these, is surely incongruous,
and fails.</p>

<p>The demand is, that the primal atoms of the cosmic
cloud, without a single logically added agent besides,
have, by combining and recombining, by changing size and
shape and intensifying the complexity of their motions, at
last emerged into ‘I am,’ ‘I can,’ ‘I ought;’ that in effect
they have written Faust and Hamlet, produced philosophies,
discovered gravitation, calculated eclipses, realized the eternal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
nobility of right and the eternal baseness of wrong: in brief,
have brought about the moral and intellectual manhood
that is ours. What we <i>know</i> by scientific evidence is this:
that the persistence of force makes the relations of
matter and force permanent. Says Faraday: ‘A particle
of oxygen is ever a particle of oxygen, nothing can in the
least wear it. If it enters into combination and reappears
as oxygen—if it pass through a thousand combinations,
animal, vegetable, mineral—if it lie hid for a thousand
years and then be evolved—it is oxygen with its first
qualities, neither more nor less. It has all its original
force, and only that.’<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Then, in all the area of the universe as we know it,
that is, within the range of our experience and experiment,
infinite vicissitude leaves what we know as an elementary
body, with its first qualities intact, neither more nor less.
But we must transcend experience, disregard the evidence
before us, and <i>believe</i> that if we give the primal atoms with
their inalienable motion <i>time enough</i>, they will emerge at
last, not only as life, but as intellect!</p>

<p>Can it avail to repudiate materialism, and yet to philosophically
conjure mind out of matter? We must indeed
recast our definition of matter to do this; but how? Says
Professor Max Müller: ‘Mill declares in one place (<i>Logic</i>
v. 3, 3) that it is a mere fallacy to say that matter cannot
think. Here again he ought to define first of all what he
means by matter, and according to his definition it may
or may not be a fallacy to say that matter cannot think.
If we say that matter cannot think, we do not say so
because we cannot conceive thought to be annexed to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
arrangement of material particles ... the reason why we
are justified in saying “matter cannot think” is our having
in our language and thought separated matter from thought,
our having called and conceived what is without thought
matter, and what is without matter thought. Having done
this, we are as certain that our matter cannot think as that
A=A and not =B.‘<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The verdict of consciousness is the immovable base of
all mental action. Our consciousness affirms our personality
and insists on our identity. The Ego is conscious
of itself as the hidden thread of unity on which are strung
all the past and present states of consciousness and thought.
Separate ‘states of consciousness’ as affections of matter we
have seen are impossible. But even if they could exist, <i>to</i>
whom is their existence? A pang of unutterable remorse,
a thrill of keenest pleasure, do not feel themselves. I feel
them; what is that I, to whom the feeling is? It is always
there, and in the language of Spencer already quoted ‘is the
unknown permanent <i>nexus</i> which is never itself a state of
consciousness, but which holds all states of consciousness
together.’ Then it is as real and more absolute than the
‘states of consciousness’ themselves.</p>

<p>The personal pronouns are as plentiful in the language
of modern materialists as in the language of sentiment or
theology. What do they represent?</p>

<p>Looking back and looking forward, thinking of ‘what
might have been’ and anticipating what will be; and
being absolutely conscious that it is ‘I’ in unchanged
and unchanging identity that am looking back upon myself,
and looking forward to myself, is unthinkable, unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
<i>something</i> to which all successive states of consciousness
have been, are, and shall be, is admitted. If I deny the
separate existence of the Ego, I to all intents and purposes
deny that I am, and yet it is I that am there, perjuring
myself by the denial.</p>

<p>Not only is there consciousness and thought, memory
and prevision, power and volition; but the person, the
identity that is conscious and thinks, that remembers and
anticipates, that is able and that wills, is an inextinguishable
factor of being. And for this there is no provision in
the formula of the Spencerian Philosophy.</p>

<p>True, as we have seen, it is fain to admit, outside its
formula, the existence of a permanent somewhat lying
beneath and outlasting all the flow of mental states; that it
has always existed, that it must exist for evermore; that it
is a ‘power’ sometimes identified with ‘force;’ but it is
contended that this is infinitely and for ever unknowable.
With this we cannot be concerned; in practice it is an
abstraction equal to nothing. But it is no element of our
analysis; it is no factor of the formula which contained the
only data required by this philosophy to construct the
universe. We cannot assume that this power was the cause
of matter, or the cause of motion; for we are shown that
we can know nothing concerning it. But this also is of no
moment; for matter, motion, and the combinations they bring
about, over countless millenniums of time, clearly understood,
and fully interpreted, are supposed to contain in themselves,
the explanation of all that is. But surely the promise of
this philosophy is unfulfilled, its pledge is broken; it left
its formula at the very outset of its career, and has employed
structural principles, which to <i>it</i> are absolutely alien.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Then to affirm that mind does not exist is impossible;
to affirm that matter gave origin to mind is a contradiction.
There is but one alternative: it is, that in the beginning,
mind, acting through and in matter, by immutable and
perfect modes, through unmeasured time, caused matter to
assume its forms and display its phenomena; and, being
mind, imparted mind to the universe wherever it is found:
crowning all, in the moral and intellectual nature of man.</p>

<p>Thus the ultimate demand of thought, of reason, and of
consciousness, is that when we are unravelling the modes of
phenomena, pushing our inquiries into the conditions of all
existences, generalizing vast areas of knowledge, expressing
in formula of geometry and numbers the splendid rhythm
and order of all things in heaven and earth, we are simply
finding, and expressing, the thoughts of an Infinite Intelligence;
discovering the modes by which His immutable
perfections were caused to take form in matter and mind.</p>

<p>It is science alone that can discover and express the
<i>mode</i> of action; it is theology alone that must strive
reverently to lead the mind up from the mode, not to the
<i>conception</i>, but to the inevitable existence and thought of
the Creator.</p>

<p>In doing this, to suppose that there are no intellectual
difficulties is to manifest narrow mental grasp; but there
are no absolute contradictions; no incongruities intolerable
to the mind. True, as we have seen above, we encounter
the inevitable fact of the uncreate existence of the Infinite.
But we have seen that this, though infinitely impenetrable
by us for ever, is still not repugnant to our reasoning and
moral faculties. Indeed the eternal existence of <i>matter</i> as
not requiring proof is one of the assumptions of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
materialists. But surely the self and necessary existence
of an intelligent omnipotence is without measure more
congruous. It has been argued that the eternity of matter
is thinkable, because matter is immutable—retains its
properties through every vicissitude conceivable in time
and space. But surely gravity is an indispensable quality
of matter; yet take a bar of iron, weighing a thousand
pounds at the sea level, four miles high, and it loses two
pounds of its weight; carry it to the distance of the moon
from the earth, and it weighs but five ounces; and at a
distance which could be computed its gravity would be
absolutely lost. It is conceivable that all the ‘modes
of motion’ by which matter is known to us, might, if
we knew enough concerning them, be found to have
conditions in which they would cease to operate. We
must know that matter is unchangeable before the argument
is valid. But even then it is incompetent.</p>

<p>What the mind asks, is power and intelligence, to account
for the majesty of the universe, and the existence of mind;
and if their cause, to be such, must be admitted to be
uncaused, the majority of reflective minds can accept this,
and in doing so, can fairly rest, and fully hope.</p>

<p>But, this granted, the question shapes itself afresh, ‘In
the beginning what?’ Had matter a coeval existence, an
eternal being like God? or did He create it? bring, what to
our senses is something, directly out of nothing? None
dare answer. Both suggestions refuse to be dealt with by
reason. But the incongruity of both might vanish like
starlight in the dawn, if we knew <i>what</i> that is, which
constitutes matter. It would, perhaps, make the Divine
mind more immanent than we could dare to imagine. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
it is easier without measure, judged of by our only source of
knowledge, our own mental experience, to conceive of matter
as a product of mind, than mind as a product of matter.</p>

<p>What, then, is it that the reverent mean by a ‘creative
act’? What is involved in the affirmation, ‘In the beginning
God created the heavens and the earth’? <i>Must</i> the
answer be speculative? or does the evidence of Nature
indicate a method? If the answer must be wholly
speculative, it is without a shred of value. But if the
<i>mode</i> of creation be a question of evidence, who are the
witnesses? They are those who are students and masters
of the <i>facts</i> of Nature. Willing or not willing, in the end,
we <i>must</i> accept the facts of Science. What, from the very
nature and constitution of our mind, we are bound to accept
as truth, it would be a travesty of all morality to ignore,
much more to reject.</p>

<p>What was gained to morals, or religion, by rejecting
Galileo’s demonstration of a revolving earth and a central
sun? When Kepler demonstrated the laws of planetary
motion, in the spirit of his age he was obliged to suppose
that the direct motion of the planets was brought about by
some spirit influence which he denominated ‘immateriate
species,’ capable of overcoming the inertia of material bodies.
But the splendid insight of Newton enabled him to perceive,
that the laws of planetary motion, were a consequence
of the cosmical law of gravitation. This took the moving
planets out of spirit hands, and reduced the music of their
motions to a method—a mechanical ‘law.’ To thousands
that was deemed a truce to ‘atheism;’ but it is an unalterable
truth; and men yet believe in God.</p>

<p>Within the range of living memory it has been held as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
vital to the existence of theology that creation, from the
stars that fringe the margin of the universe, to the earth,
and the crown of manhood, arose in six literal days. But
science, with no weapon but inexorable fact, has made this
for ever untenable. But the foundations of religion are
unshaken.</p>

<p>Science has removed whole regions and æons of phenomena,
from what was considered the supernatural, to the
natural; but to believe that this is so much lost to theology
is a feeble and faithless fallacy.</p>

<p>That conception of the Great Creator which takes its
rise in the majestic law of universal gravitation must be
sublimer than that which thought of Him as telling off
spirits to move, and bear up the planets, in their paths.</p>

<p>Can that be a higher view of an illimitable Creative
Mind, which conceived of Him as a Power who caused the
earth to be formed, and the heavens to be filled, in six
literal days, rather than to think of Him to whom there
can be no yesterday and no to-morrow, but an unchanging
now, as determining laws and forces, which, in the slow
progression of uncounted ages, should express His creative
will and accomplish His Divine idea?</p>

<p>I have read in vain, I have thought in vain, to understand
what to later theologians was the method and the
meaning of a creative act. ‘Order is heaven’s first law;’ and
law—method—is the very pulse of order. Surely creative
action in matter could only have proceeded by law? It
could only have been the prevision and predetermination,
by the inscrutable Creator, of definite affections of matter
by force, issuing in rhythmic motions and cosmic harmonies,
which, by their progress through immeasurable time, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
accomplish the creative purpose. ‘Let there be light;’
that is the equivalent, in human thought, of an incomprehensible
Divine volition. ‘And there was light,’ that is,
in human phrase, the affirmation of its historic accomplishment.
But to those who know, as we at present do, the
science of light, what time, what power, what majesty of
method, did its perfect accomplishment involve!</p>

<p>‘And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of
heaven.’ That, in human phrase, and according to human
modes of thought, expresses the mysterious intent of
Almighty Mind to fill space with the splendour we see; and
to people it with intelligence of which we can form no faintest
vision. ‘And it was so,’ that is the record of the realized
intent. But how realized? Not by a material actor who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Rounded in his palm those spacious orbs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bowled them flaming through the dark profound.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That is impossible to thought; a travesty of the sublimer
conceptions possible, even to finite minds. Then do we
conceive them as, in our human sense, leaping into existence
and place and relation and motion and order? All our
knowledge repudiates this merely human conception.</p>

<p>The only conception we can justly form is, that in the
awful mystery of creative action, Divine will determined
law, modes of affection of matter by motion, through force:
making the dome of heaven and the peopled earth the
realized will of the Eternal.</p>

<p>‘And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living
creature after his kind.’ That is the utterance of the
human conception, which can alone represent to us the
Divine resolve to fill the earth with life—and the joy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
living things. ‘And it was so.’ But what epochs of
countless ages filled the incalculable interval! What life
on life, through age on age, moved in stately march from the
lower to the higher, while the rocks kept imperishable
record! The facts of geology, so far as they carry us, are
more accurate and certain than any records of human
history. And the irresistible lesson taught by the accurate
study of the fossil flora and fauna, from the dawn of the
Laurentian epoch, is a persistent and upward unfolding of
life-forms by law; and the operation of the law is as
manifest, as the operation of the law of increasing adaptation
is visible, in a historical study of naval architecture, from
the first rude plank, the dangerous raft, right up, through
all increasing adjustments and improved design, to the latest
ship with stately curves and splendid speed.</p>

<p>There is a sense indeed in which creation by evolution
or development is taking place for ever around us. Development
is evolution beginning at a fixed point; evolution is
only development <i>ab initio</i>.</p>

<p>Every spore that unfolds itself into a fern, every seed
that gives origin to another tenant of the forest, every egg
that peoples earth or air or sea with another life, is an
instance of development. It is only abbreviated evolution;
evolution which gives a written record of its laws in every
stage, down to the primitive ovum. There the record of
the organism in itself ceases. The primitive ovum is a
simple cell. The worm, the grayling, the eagle, the man,
are evolved from such.</p>

<p>But can the egg unfold itself from this protoplasmic
speck by any process save that of predetermined law and
energy? Is not every law that shall act, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
unchangeable power to enforce it, contained potentially in
that globule of matter which we cannot see? Every
change that is wrought, from the first that is discoverable,
to the last that ensues, in the evolving egg, is one unbroken
stream of method; force, with mandates, as it were, acting
on matter, with special adaptations. Never did human
mechanist strive more visibly to embody his prescribed
purpose than do the progressive activities of the embryo
lead straight to the final result. They did not, as movements,
determine their own actions, or the actions of each
other; they all lay together potentially from the first.</p>

<p>In this, if you will carry back the conception of Divine
law and purpose to the beginning, and apply it to the
incomprehensible majesty of the universe, I can see a
miniature of suggestion as to the creative method.</p>

<p>Can it strip theology of one ray of the splendour of
Deity, to find, from the evidence of nature, that He thought,
and willed into action, the balanced forces and immutable
laws, which were so related to each other, and to the foreseen
requirements of onward and upward movement, that
their progress is music, and their products are harmonies?—perfect
adjustments—and, amidst ever-changing circumstances,
ever-changing adaptations and self-adjusted design?</p>

<p>Can there be any splendour of the Infinite mind more
ineffable and effulgent than the evidence, in His works, that
in the beginning He determined the potency and prevision
of all the life, and all the adaptations, that ever have
emerged or can emerge?</p>

<p>Will it be urged that this one comprehensive law of
creative action, with all its methods and potentialities
complete in the beginning, must denude history of miracle?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
must make all things inevitable sequences, and every outcome
in nature through all time only what must be, when
the moment for its emergence had come? And that therefore
the unforeseen would be impossible. I submit that
such an inference is not inevitable. The universe becomes
one lasting act of the unsearchable but immanent Eternal.
The power by which the self-adjusting mechanism of the
universe acts, took its rise, and has its continuity, in Him.</p>

<p>A miracle, in its broadest aspect, is a wonderful event;
something, which from the known course of phenomena,
science could not previse. Science would stultify her past
and make impossible her future, if she affirmed that the
unprevised and marvellous could not happen. Says Professor
Huxley: ‘A miracle, in the sense of a sudden and
complete change in the customary order of nature, is
intelligible, can be distinctly conceived, implies no contradiction;
and therefore, according to Hume’s own showing,
cannot be proved false by any demonstrative argument.’<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Our knowledge of the observed processes of nature erects
no mental barrier to the occurrence of something never before
observed. Miracles are not, it is now broadly admitted,
dependent on science, but on <i>evidence</i> for their possibility
and truth. Nay, more, it is conceivable that, what to us
might be profoundly miraculous, might be the outcome of
sheer and unmodified natural law.</p>

<p>If we could annul the interval of time between the great
minds of the long past and bring them into direct and
intelligent contact with the most marked victories of modern
research and genius, what would be the effect? Let it be
imagined that Aristotle or Plato could stand by while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Tyndall demonstrated to them in Athens, that they could
hold direct and instant intercourse with a friend in India;
or proved to them, that we can demonstrate the actual
constituents of the sun and stars, and their physical conditions,
with the same certainty as we can determine the
analysis of an earthly compound; or bid the sunbeam
paint the portrait of a bird or beast in rapid motion; or
let them gaze upon the marvellous world of the minute
unfolded by the modern microscope; and I do not hesitate
to say that if he were the Aristotle or Plato of his own
age, standing before these triumphs of this age, he would be
standing in the presence of absolute miracles. Yet how
have these, to Plato, unforeseen and wonderful events
arisen? Only by discovery of, and absolute obedience to,
the <i>laws of nature</i> as they are for ever and immutably acting.
Man has created nothing, interrupted nothing, violated
nothing: he has obeyed; and by obedience conquered.</p>

<p>Then grant that mind, by infinite wisdom and will, gave
origin to this ever-unfolding universe, by methods that are
all and for ever known to Him, as they can never be
known to us, is it according to reason to contend that
nothing shall ever happen <i>even according to the strict
methods of natural phenomena</i> which past experience has
never known?</p>

<p>That will happen, on the assumption of a Creative Mind
as the origin of all, which is <i>needful</i>, to complete the
universe; and what happens need be no interruption, no
turning aside, of the course of nature, but only sublime
compliance with it.</p>

<p>But more: one of the gravest conflicts of sheer material
philosophy with Theism and Theology is, that by mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
evolution design is swept clean from the universe; that
teleology has received its death-blow.</p>

<p>Science finds that phenomena are self-acting, and self-adjusting.
The energy is competent; the method is perfect
for bringing about the result investigated. Science can find
no more; it asks no more; and materialism says, there is
no more. There is no design in it; it is, because to be at
all, it must be that. There is no design in the form of
the river-bed which the mighty waters have engraved for
themselves in their irresistible movement down the mountain
slope and along the windings of the valley to the sea. It
is the result of the force of gravity. Such is the argument.</p>

<p>But while science as such, in strict obedience to its
canons, must stop at the self-adjustment of immediate
phenomena, and materialism will stop there, the reasoning
faculties of the race, as we have seen, will not stop there.
They must come at last, by the laws of reason, upon the
power and the intelligence by which the methods of nature
were made self-acting. Gravitation and the properties of
water will account for the perfect adaptation of the river to
its bed, and the bed to the purpose of a river. But how came
gravity? How came the properties of water? There may
be, there is, no direct design in the path of the Amazon or
the Danube; but surely there is magnificence in the design
that caused the great, the cosmic <i>methods</i> of nature so to
co-operate as to cause those rivers inevitably to carve their
perfect paths? The dynamics of nature are self-acting up
to the very limit of our power of research; but after that,
and beyond it, what? Why is the <i>direction</i> of nature’s
dynamical methods always and everywhere, through all
time and space, beneficent and beautiful?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>It is only the design, the teleology, of the old school,
touched by the Ithuriel spear of modern knowledge, and
changing into a conception of universal design, that can
only have originated in an infinite mind.</p>

<p>The ‘law of evolution’ and that of ‘variation and the
survival of the fittest’ may, if you will, be held to account
for all that narrower knowledge had attributed to direct
design. But evolution, like gravitation, is only a method;
and the self-adjustments demonstrated in the ‘origin of
species’ only make it, to reason, the clearer, that variation
and survival is a method that took its origin in mind. It
is true that the egg of a moth, and the eye of a dogfish, and
the forearm of a tiger <i>must</i> be what they are to accomplish
the end of their being. But that only shows, as we shade
our mental eyes, and gaze back to the beginning, the magnificence
of the design that was <i>in</i>volved in nature’s beginning,
so as to be <i>e</i>volved, by the designed rhythm of nature’s
methods.</p>

<p>Whatever matter may be; whatever force is; or whether
or not both are the one inseverable product of omnipotent
volition; the first affection of matter by force carried with
it, potentially, the finished purpose of the All-wise, whatever
that may be. Every instance of what such writers as
Darwin are obliged to write of as ‘contrivance’ or ‘adaptation’
throughout this universe as it now is, or that shall yet
arise in it through all duration, are, and will be, but factors
of related harmony in a stupendously vast interlocked
‘mosaic’ of design, which in its entirety has a ‘final
purpose’ too great for man to see.</p>

<p>It is admitted by the fullest and farthest thinkers, that
the teleological, and the mechanical views, of phenomena<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and their origin, are not antagonistic. Instead of mutually
excluding each other in thought, they are the complement
of each other.</p>

<p>To argue, that because we can by analysis and research,
discover and demonstrate the physical conditions or antecedents,
that, apparently automatically, bring about a manifest
contrivance, therefore, we have excluded the possibility
of any universal primal design, is a mode of reasoning, the
fallacy of which, surely, needs no great logical acumen to
lay bare.</p>

<p>Because we discover the molecular shapes and movements
that determine the structure of a beautiful crystal, it would
be surely illogical and unwarranted to say that there was
no design, no arrangement in the primary order of things,
out of which these very conditions arose. It is conceivable
that there may be infinitely more mind in the origination
of that which automatically gives rise to a manifest ‘contrivance,’
than in directly originating it.</p>

<p>An ordinary watch is, as a rule, a good timekeeper,
under a fixed, say a temperate meridian; but take it to the
arctic circle, and it goes too fast; or to the torrid zone,
and it goes too slow. But in a chronometer, delicate compensations
are made, of a beautiful kind, so contrived as to
counteract the thermal changes. Would it be logical to
think of the more complex contrivance as devoid of design
because it is self-acting?</p>

<p>I grant that there may not be absolute parity of reasoning
in the human as compared with the natural instance;
but I only desire the reasoning to apply to one essential
point. If primarily the methods of nature, which by their
rhythmic action automatically produce contrivances, living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
or otherwise, took their origin in mind, the contrivances so
produced were so designed to be produced; and this is
contrivance of an infinitely higher order than the self-compensating
balance of the chronometer. It is contrivances
brought about by arrangements that are infinitely complex,
transcending all thought; and which include in their vast
sweep, all time, all space, all matter, all motion, and all
their relations, from the most inconceivably minute phenomenon
to the most stupendous that ever has happened, or
can happen, as a product of nature.</p>

<p>We may easily reduce this to a practical form by
illustration. The arm or fore-limb of all mammals is constructed
essentially on the same type. The forearm of the
horse is most highly specialized. In the forearm there
is, as in the human skeleton, the <i>radius</i> and the <i>ulna</i>.
But the ulna has lost its function, and is fused with the
radius. What we call the knee in the horse’s fore-limb is
really the wrist. There are eight bones in the human
wrist. The horse has only seven. Now, immediately
succeeding the wrist bones in the human hand, are the five
bones that form the palm; and these are followed by the
five digits or fingers.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that, unlike the majority of mammal
hands, the horse is peculiar. Instead of five bones corresponding
to the palm bones, it has only one, which is called
the ‘cannon bone;’ and this is followed by but one digit
or finger with a huge nail. The horse then walks upon a
single finger, viz. the third, on each fore foot and each hind
foot. Why is this? and can we discover the history of
this modification?</p>

<p>Examine the cannon bone of a horse with care; you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
find fixed on either side of it two delicate bones, called
‘splints,’ with actually no mission in the economy of the
extant horse.</p>

<p>Now go steadily back in geological time. There are
three great geological epochs, the primary, the secondary,
and the tertiary. The recent period called the quaternary
is a sub-section of the last. Now in the quaternary and
upper tertiary, fossil horses are found. They correspond
with the horses we see. But in the middle of the tertiary
epoch we come upon the horse, not only in Europe, but in
India, and above all in America, with the splint bones, that
we find in extant horses fixed to the cannon bone, as long as
that bone itself, and provided with small spurious or useless
hoofs, while the ulna can be traced for its whole length.</p>

<p>In the earliest miocene deposits the horse is found with
these spurious or partially aborted toes, no longer useless,
but having the full length of the middle toe; making the
horse of that epoch a distinctly three-toed creature, and
each toe operative; while the forearm is in a condition
normal to mammals.</p>

<p>Yet another form, found in America, shows, not only
the three distinct and useful toes, but upon the third
toe a splint, suggesting a rudiment of the little or fifth
finger; while in the oldest of the tertiary rocks has
again been found a horse with the fourth finger complete.
While finally, in the very earliest tertiary deposits is
found a horse with a foot of four perfect digits, consisting
of the second, the third, the fourth, and fifth fingers,
with a rudiment or splint of the first finger distinctly
visible.</p>

<p>Similar facts reveal themselves in relation to the hind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
feet and legs; and slow variations palpably affected the
entire body of the successive types of horse; the teeth,
for example, undergoing remarkable successive modifications:
and whilst the <i>Eohippus</i> and the <i>Orohippus</i>, the
last types of horse, discovered respectively in the oldest and
later of the eocene beds, possess forty-four teeth, as in a
large number of fossil and extant mammalian forms, the
recent horse has the number reduced to forty, and their forms
remarkably altered, as the final outcome of a succession of
modifications.</p>

<p>We have here, then, a series of generic types; for the true
relations of which to each other we are indebted to the
insight of such workers as Huxley and Marsh and Lartet,
and others. They do not afford us illustrations of the
minute and scarcely observable modifications which the law
of the origin of species involves; they present us rather
with a series of family groups; but the relation between
them is such as to leave the mind accustomed to biological
investigations convinced, that, could we see all the forms
that occurred between them, there could be no question as
to the origin of these forms, from <i>eohippus</i> of the oldest
eocene beds to <i>equus</i> of to-day. Unlike as in a general
sense they are, they are progressive modifications, with
higher and higher specializations, until, in the extant horse,
the highest special modification is attained.</p>

<p>It will harmonize with no dogma of theology, and no
doctrine of science, to assume that these equine forms,
separated by such enormous epochs of time, were specially
created: all accurate knowledge forbids the supposition;
while varieties sufficiently marked, such as the race-horse,
the giant and powerful dray-horse, the Shetland and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Norman ponies, known to be derived from a common parentage,
give the clearest sanction to the inference, that what
we now know of the geological history of the horse proves
it to be a product of the Darwinian law of evolution; that
there has been no total destruction of equine (or any other)
life in the great past; but that there has been a continuity
of it, borne from region to region, and modified continuously
by a thousand changing circumstances. Consequently
we find, in the rocky records of the past, that organic
types become simpler, and liker to each other, as we trace
them through the incomplete geological record to a dim and
far off age.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a series of such generalized types,
plainly related to each other in time, leading us down from
the horse of historic times to less and less specialized forms
of it, as the epoch grows more remote; until in the upper
mesozoic or lower eocene beds, we find the progenitor of
the line of the equine types we know, to be an animal with
a splay foot of five toes, adapted to slow movement in a
boggy soil. The slow specialization adapted it to increasing
rapidity and ease of movement, and modified states of soil;
acting, without doubt, as an increasing protection against its
enemies, and providing it with an ever surer means of obtaining
abundant and suitable food. And beneficial variation
continued to act until the noble horse, beautiful in form,
exquisitely graceful in action, and swift as the wind, had
been thus created.</p>

<p>Now the most absolutely assured, the most universally
accepted truth within the whole realm of human knowledge
and experience is the immutability of nature’s laws; and
the certainty that their action has been ‘established for ever’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
through all space and all time. Great as was the knowledge
of ancient and classic peoples, that of which they
knew relatively least, was nature. This arose from their
inability to perceive the inexpressible vastness of nature, on
the one hand, and the detailed constitution of the earth and
its universal flora and fauna, on the other. The obvious
inference as to the origin of the universe, as they knew it,
was, that all that constituted the world and its occupants
and inhabitants, mineral, vegetable, and animal, were individual
direct creations. But, knowing as we now know,
the immutability and universality of the laws of nature, in
relation equally to the organic and living as to the inorganic
and not-living, and knowing as we do the geological and
palæontological history of the earth, and the nature and
characteristics of its living inhabitants, it is as manifest as
the axioms of geometry, that the direct and supra-natural
creation of new species, or even new genera, is absolutely
untenable.</p>

<p>Now modern biological science, guided by the splendid
genius and ceaseless research of Darwin, and the whole
field of biologists, for the past quarter of a century, has
been able for all practical purposes to discover and demonstrate
a great ‘law’ or method, according to which all the
varieties of living ‘species,’ animal and vegetable, have
arisen; connecting the remotest ages of the life of the globe
with the present flora and fauna in one unbroken continuity,
by one unchanging method. The organic history of any
individual becomes an analogue of the organic history of
the world. The individual begins existence as a minute
ovum, and progresses to completeness. The vast series of
organic forms, fossil and extant, began in one or more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
‘primordial germs.’ The law of all living things, and
especially the lowliest, is rapid and abundant reproduction.
Variations in individuals so reproduced are as absolutely
universal as reproduction itself. It does not require the
accurate knowledge of the botanist or the zoologist to
discover this. A careful study of any group of living
forms, lowly or highly organized, will make this palpable to
any observer. The septic organisms, for example, which
arise from germs (not those which arise from self-division)
constantly vary; and I have been able to make use of this
tendency so as to enable three of these wonderful organic
and vital specks to slowly change, so as to adapt themselves
to changed environments, until, in the course of years,
from normally living at a temperature of 60° Fahr. they
lived at last, and multiplied enormously, at a temperature
of 157° Fahr.; and in the slow process of adaptation,
demonstrated fundamental changes were undergone by the
organisms.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>A study of the Desmids, the Diatoms, the Radiolaria,
or the Foraminifera amongst minute organisms will show
that variations are so constant and so numerous, that the
determination of what is called species, is difficult, and at
times, impossible.</p>

<p>Who does not know of the varieties that are annually
produced from seed-growths of favourite flowering plants?—the
pelargonium, the primula, the viola, the rose, and
hundreds of others.</p>

<p>That this is not confined to forms under cultivation is
equally manifest. Common observation has not noted it
perhaps, but there are no fewer than thirteen distinct forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of the common bramble or blackberry, with stem, flower, and
fruit sufficiently varied to have induced some botanists to
consider them species. Although each when seen is called
by the majority of people ‘the wild rose,’ there are at the
very least seventeen natural varieties. ‘Artificial selection’
has had no part in these variations and a thousand others
that might be named.</p>

<p>Consider the variations constantly arising in fowls,
canaries, dogs, and cattle. No litter of kittens is ever
precisely alike, or precisely like either parent; and this
is true even in human families.</p>

<p>Variation, then, is constant and universal; it acts in
all directions and in every living thing. If, amidst the
exigencies of the history of an organism, some variation in
the progeny is beneficial in altered circumstances, it is by
the very nature of things preserved. The offspring of all
living organisms are greatly in excess of the number that
can reach maturity; and with variations in every organism,
and in every part of their organization, for ever occurring;
and environments, during great cycles of time, undergoing
constant and enormous changes; it is palpable that successive
modifications must arise, and through all the countless ages
of the past have arisen: resulting always in the ‘survival of
the fittest’ or ‘natural selection,’ which ‘signifies the preservation
of favourable individual differences and variations,
and the destruction of those which are injurious.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This is
palpable, for individuals possessed of advantage over others
must have the best chance of surviving and multiplying
their kind; hence arise ‘varieties,’ ‘races,’ and ‘species;’
and if the enormous age of the period of life upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
globe, and the vicissitudes through which it has passed,
be taken into account, it is impossible for a biologist to
withhold consent to the fact that a ‘law,’ a method, has
been demonstrated, which has been a certain and powerful
factor, in producing the variety of the flora and fauna that
have filled the earth, from the dawn of life upon the globe, up
to the extant animals and vegetables which are the latest
outcome of this great law. This is the conviction of all
the experts of the world.</p>

<p>That there are other factors of evolution not yet discovered
is almost inevitable; they, however, will be but
added ‘laws;’ supplementary and co-ordinated methods—giving
greater completeness to our knowledge of the origin
of species.</p>

<p>But having reached this conclusion, we are at once
compelled to ask, What is the origin of this unceasing
continuity of variation in all living things? this power to
become constantly adapted to change of environment, and
for ever, in the fittest form, to survive? Is not this
palpably a creative method? Is it not the emergence in
time and history of the thought and will of the Creative
Power in the beginning?—one of the processes that
lay enfolded in the very purpose of the production of
heaven and earth, and which as a prevised method
only awaited ‘the fulness of time’ to come inevitably
into play?</p>

<p>The earth, as is well known, and we have already pointed
out, is constantly subject to minute, as well as to smaller
cyclic and great secular, changes. Nothing but an ability to
become adapted through all duration to current and recurrent
changes, could have made a continuity of the living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
population of the globe possible. We have found the
principal ‘law’ of those adaptive changes. But because we
have learned the nature of the law or method, by which
throughout all time, these changes have been brought about;
and because the method <i>appears</i> self-acting like the balance
wheel of a chronometer, must we argue that there is no
design either in the method or its results? That will not
satisfy the constant demands of reason. Finding the law
according to which a projectile moves, must not be confounded
with the cause of its motion.</p>

<p>‘Natural selection’ cannot originate anything. Variation
does not explain itself. Why is it a property of all living
things to vary indefinitely and in all directions? The
Darwinian law has no existence without it; but that
‘law’ no more accounts for this tendency, than the law
of falling bodies explains gravitation, or shows why it
acts as it does.</p>

<p>It is easy to explain the law of the compensations of a
chronometer balance, or a compensating clock pendulum;
but that does not account for their existence.</p>

<p>The law of ‘inheritance,’ the likeness of progeny to
parents, is, like the law of variation, universal. But why
is it so? If it were not so, there could be no survival of
the fittest. Yet it is no more explained by the discovery
of that law, than the nature of that which thinks, is
explained by a discovery of the laws of thought.</p>

<p>Selection implies alternatives to select from. The splendid
organic mechanism of all the animals of the earth, with
their perfect relations to their sphere, could as a whole, only
have been brought about by means that started for, and led
to, that goal. ‘The law by which structures originate is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
one thing; those by which they are restricted, directed, or
destroyed is another.’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>


<p>Then, because the horse becomes specialized and adapted
to its circumstances in a remarkable manner, leaving
evidence in the rocks of long severed but successive epochs,
of the very manner in which it was created as we know it;
and because we have proof that this method is practically
self-acting, shall we stultify reason by assuming that in its
self-action there is no design? that as a great rhythmic law
it had no origin? that, because to our powers of observation
it is automatic, it explains its own existence? or
that it strips the mind, by this very automatism, of any
necessity for, or right of, having its origin explained?
None of these assumptions are congruous; they surely
violate the fundamental principles of thought.</p>

<p>We may be enabled no longer to say of any structure
that it is a ‘final cause;’ our insight is not deep enough for
that; but an equally powerful weapon in defence of
theism takes its place: I designate it ‘<span class="allsmcap">CONCURRENT
ADAPTATION</span>;’ that is, <i>fitness</i>, for ever, throughout all
time and all space; and fitness absolutely constant amidst
all changes. Adaptation is universally concurrent with
existence; and whether we have to account for it by
sudden and unexplained action, or by the slow operation
of laws, is a matter of no essential moment: <i>it is there</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing, for example, can be more certain, than the
powerful influence exerted on the coloration and morphology
of flowers, all over the earth, by the visits of
insects. The insects assiduously visit flowers for food, or
nectar; and by their visits the pollen of one flower is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
carried to the stigmatic surface of another: so effecting
cross fertilization. The contrivances for making insect
agency efficient, are so numerous, so palpable, and so
exquisitely perfect as to entrance the observer. One
flower has its nectar in a tube, to reach which the proboscis
of the visiting insect must touch and split a delicate tissue
and expose the moist adhesive surfaces of a couple of
pollen masses, which adhere to and are carried away by
the insect, in such a position that, in visiting another
flower of the same species, it must deposit the pollen
where alone it can do its fertilizing work.</p>

<p>Another flower is so contrived, that to reach the nectar,
the visiting insect must touch a sensitive surface causing
the rupture of a tissue, which confines a pollen mass; but,
on the rupture of the tissue, this flies out like an arrow
at the unbidden guest; and an adhesive end sticks to the
insect, which is startled away; but, visiting another flower
of a like kind, deposits, in the right place, the fertilizing
pollen it unconsciously carries.</p>

<p>Another flower has an ingenious arrangement by which
it lures an insect into its corolla, and then imprisons it,
provided with plenty of food, until its anthers are ripe,
when it sheds their pollen over the insect; after which,
by a special organic arrangement, it opens the prison door
and lets its visitor emerge, charged with pollen, to visit
another similar flower, which will inevitably be in a condition
to receive fertilization from its pollen-covered body.</p>

<p>Thousands of other instances might be given.</p>

<p>Now we know perfectly the mutability of flowers. It
is highly probable that the visiting insect and the visited
flower were wholly unlike, in some instances, what they now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
are, twenty thousand years ago; and it is equally improbable
that they will be what they now are, twenty thousand
years hence. But that which this great biological law
affirms, is, that whatever the changes, and however brought
about, past or future, there never has been, there is not, and
there never will be, an instant’s cessation of concurrent
adaptation:—the operation of the ‘law’ that secures to all
that lives adjustment to its environments. That surely
must be a method that took its origin in mind; and it must
have had its prevised and preordered place potentially
assigned, from the earliest creative movement; as it must
continue to have unceasing action to the very terminus of
all organic existence.</p>

<p>Design, purpose, intention, appear, then, when all the
facts of the universe are studied in the light of all our
reasoning faculties, to be ineradicable from our view of the
creation. Teleology does not now depend for its existence
on Paleyean ‘instances;’ but all the universe, its whole
progress in time and space, is one majestic evidence of
teleology. The will and purpose running through it are
as incapable of being shut out of our consciousness and
reasoning faculties, as its phenomena and their modes are
of being rendered wholly imperceptible by our senses.</p>

<p>A ‘mind’ that is not a mind, in any sense as we know it,
is, to us, nothing. Will, to be will, to us, must be such as
we know of; though it be infinite. Intelligence that is
infinite cannot cease to be intelligence. To an infinite
intelligence, as to us, in the same conditions, the properties
of conic sections must be what we know them to be. But
an Infinite Mind would differ absolutely from ours in that
there could be nothing tentative, nothing experimental in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
its methods, through all time and space. Only the right
means would ever be employed, or the right ends ever be
brought about. But, surely, even an Infinite will, in the
realm of matter, must <i>use</i> means. When human power
takes a pebble from a great height and places it at the sea-level
it has only done what gravity could have done. But
when human will by continuity of purpose combines
materials to form a calculating machine, we have an
evidence of the action of mind; something, which, while
it is made and exists by the very laws of nature, yet the
laws of nature could not, by themselves, have made.</p>

<p>Similar results must be due, then, to similar conditions.
The teleology, that is the inseverable motive, as it were, of
all the activities and interactions of nature, must be the
product of mind.</p>

<p>Then was <i>man</i>, as a physical being, the terminal link in
the great progressive chain of living forms that had peopled
the earth through countless ages? Or does he, in physical
origin, stand apart? Is he a being from whose existence a
new creative epoch dates? Or is he the final product of the
vast ancestral line of life that ran through all the ages?
Did God make man ‘of the dust of the ground’ by some
process of which we can form no conception, and can discover
no trace? Or is there evidence that the Creator
made man of the dust of the ground by majestic laws,
acting over vast epochs, until he had become meet for the
inbreathing of a higher nature?</p>

<p>That is a question of profoundest interest. But if the
authoritative and final demonstration were given either
way to-morrow, we, in ourselves, should remain unaltered.
We should be conscious of no uplifting and of no fall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Immediate or mediate creation, if God be the author, must
be alike Divine. To fear the consequences of honest truth
seeking research on this momentous question, is to manifest
little love of truth for its own sake, on the one hand; and
little stalwartness of personal conviction, as to the security
of the foundation of professed beliefs, on the other.
Whether we will or not, the whole matter will be searched
to its deepest depths. But amidst all the conflict of
opinion as to details, in one thing all are agreed, and that
is, that the gulf between man and the noblest apes is such
as to be practically without comparison. Whatever science
may be able to show ultimately as to the relation of man
to the anthropoid apes, there is to-day no biologically
demonstrated and direct kinship. That the anthropoid
apes, as we know them, were in any proper sense the <i>direct</i>
ancestors of man, is not a serious contention of even extreme
evolutionists. The facts before us do not justify it. The
highest ape is still an ape; and whilst the oldest human
remains, such as the Eugis and Neanderthal skulls,
discovered in association with evidences of immense
antiquity, have remarkable characteristics, pointing in some
respects in the direction of the great apes, they are still
the crania of men. After a critical and exhaustive examination
of the two skulls above referred to, Professor Huxley
says concerning the Eugis skull: ‘Its measurements agree
equally well with those of some European skulls. And
assuredly there is no mark of degradation about any part
of its structure. It is, in fact, a fair average human skull,
which might have belonged to a philosopher, or might have
contained the thoughtless brains of a savage.’<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> And in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
summing up the results of an equally critical examination
of the far more remarkable Neanderthal skull, the same
unquestionable authority says: ‘In no sense, then, can the
Neanderthal bones be regarded as the remains of a human
being intermediate between men and apes. At most they
demonstrate the existence of a <i>man</i> whose skull may be
said to revert somewhat towards the pithecoid type....
And indeed, though truly the most pithecoid of known
human skulls, the Neanderthal cranium is by no means so
isolated as it appears to be at first, but forms in reality the
extreme term of a series leading gradually from it to the
highest and best developed of human crania.’<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Nothing
has arisen to seriously modify these authoritative statements.
No thorough anatomist practically familiar with
the structure of the anthropoids on the one side, and man
on the other, could attempt to argue that man can be
directly a descendant of chimpanzee, gorilla, or orang. ‘I
may say,’ says Huxley, ‘that the fossil remains of man
hitherto discovered do not seem to me to take us
appreciably nearer to that lower pithecoid form, by the
modification of which he has probably become what he is.’<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>But let us beware of mistaking, or even distorting, the
true meaning of this, as understood by the philosophical
evolutionist. It does not for a moment place the physical
nature of man outside the range of the great creative law
of natural selection. No arrangement of the monkeys can
present us with a rational order of development, of which
man is physically the latest and highest outcome. But the
precursor of man, of whose actual existence no direct proof
has yet arisen, is assumed, on the evidence of absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
innumerable details, the full value of which is only to be
clearly seen by experts, to have ascended, not from any
anthropoid,—chimpanzee, gorilla, nor orang,—but these
apes are found to form the nearest branch existing, produced
by the same trunk, out of which, physically, man’s
nature was, by the law of descent, evolved.</p>

<p>That the embryological and anatomical resemblances
between man and the highest apes are of a profound and
striking character, no sane educated man would attempt to
traverse; and that this involves close biological relationship,
and proves the operation on each, of the same organic laws
of development, so far as physical origin is concerned, is also
certain.</p>

<p>That there are evidences of an antiquity of the human
race, as such, immensely disproportionate to that indicated
in the absolutely unreliable and useless ‘received’ chronologies,
it would be folly to doubt and immorality to neglect.
It is evidenced by man’s works, which are shown, without
question, to be of indefinitely vast antiquity; and correspond,
in the main, with the works of races of men still living. It
is shown by the enormous antiquity of races of men as we
know them; by the vast age of languages, made evident, by
a deep analysis of their structure, as sister and parent
languages; as well as by the great age of even human
remains.</p>

<p>Now all this, taken in connection with the anatomical
structure and embryological development of man, makes it
impossible to suppose that man’s physical nature was not a
product of the same great creative laws, the same vital
processes, as those that gave origin to the chimpanzee or the
gorilla; a slow creation, through a long line of varied life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
from ‘the dust of the ground,’ the elements of the earth.
There is in this relation an almost marvellous insight in
David’s song:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘I will give thanks unto Thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wonderful are Thy works;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that my soul knoweth right well.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My frame was not hidden from Thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I was made in secret,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">When as yet there was none of them.’<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By what link man is united physically to the great series
below him, by what line and in what specific manner he
arose, it has not yet been given to science to determine.
Biological science sees, with inevitable certainty, that he
must have been in vital union with that series; that
physically he is a part of the majestic organic whole, from
the first dawn of life upon the globe until now.</p>

<p>At the same time it is equally certain that other agencies
which could not have acted on ape or other mammal, nor
indeed on any other living form besides, came into operation,
when man, as such, became an inhabitant of this earth.</p>

<p>Nor is it by any means other than conceivable that
science, which has transformed the face of the world in fifty
years, may be able to demonstrate the actual physical line
of man’s origin. But if that be so, if the line along which
man’s physical nature was moulded of the dust of the ground,
by the Creative Mind and will, were made so plain that
none could refuse the evidence, it may leave undisturbed
our mental peace, and unaltered our conviction of the dignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
and majesty of man. It would leave our responsibilities
undiminished, our rights uninfringed, and our hopes unclouded.</p>

<p>The saint is none the less saintly, because he is ancestrally
the last, and prevised outcome, of an inconceivably grand
progression of creative laws, operating through countless
cycles, than he would have been, as the descendant of a
man produced by an isolated act of creation. The song of
the nightingale is no iota less rich in fluent melody because
its larynx was modified from less melodious forms; and the
martyrdom of Paul, or the noble sacrifices of heroes and
reformers to secure the sacred rights of liberty and truth
for their fellow-men, are none the less exalted because
we must trace their ancestry to the slow operation of
creative laws, which in the great unbroken stream of life
upon the earth gave origin to the monod, the coral-polyp,
the mollusc, the lizard, the aye-aye, and the chimpanzee.
Verily, if the researches of science demonstrate
that this was the method of creative action, we may not
murmur.</p>

<p>The sovereignty of man does not depend on a particular
view of the exact manner in which the Creator caused the
elements of the earth to produce his frame. ‘And the
Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground;’ it is
not <i>how</i> He so formed him. None has power to affirm or to
deny how, unless with reverent hands he find it written in
the rocks, or woven indelibly with the very structure of
man himself. It is because men have interpreted, without
evidence, the stages of creative action, and welded these
non-essentials with iron girdles of dogma, that faith has
again and again been imperilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The true crown of manhood, the final majesty and exalted
mystery of creative power, was not man’s <i>body</i>, but his soul.
‘And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and he
became a living soul,’ is the expression of that which gives
his unshared dignity to man.</p>

<p>What is meant by this, who shall explain? Who
can peer into the depths of a mystery so profound?
It defies all our powers of search; dare we make a
special interpretation or understanding of how this was
brought about, an essential of belief? Is it not enough
that it was the supreme, as it was, so far as our
present knowledge will carry us, the final outcome of
creation?</p>

<p>When the Creative Power and wisdom had built man’s
physical nature of the dust of the ground, whether suddenly
or slowly, by this method or by that, He breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living
soul. It was the possession of what we call the soul that
gave to the manhood its being. How this was imparted,
who can know? who shall explain? Even if the very
<i>method</i> be at last discovered, or approximated, the unalterable
question must remain, <i>why</i> the method, the law,
brought about so sublime a result, and from whence came
the conditions that made the laws direct themselves to
such an exalted end. In fine, how physical laws could so
be caused to act as to give origin to consciousness, thought,
and moral faculties. Plainly, this ‘end’ must have lain
in the Divine ‘beginning;’ and we must go behind and
below the mechanics of phenomena and explain their <i>vera
causa</i>; we must find our way above matter not-living in
the great past, and fathom the very essence of the cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
that made it live, before we can attempt to explain the
origin of that self in man which looks upon and <i>knows itself</i>.
We have seen that matter and force will not, as sole factors,
lend themselves to a philosophy of the origin and explanation
of this. A linear arrangement of the ascending
mentality of brutes does not really explain, or even minimize,
the difficulties of the problem. It simply makes the area
of the problem the wider.</p>

<p>‘I am,’ ‘I can,’ ‘I ought,’ ‘I think,’ with equal
freedom—of an atom or a universe, of a rosebud or a
Deity, of myself or of my race, of the grandeur of right
and the baseness of wrong—these are the impenetrable
mysteries which no property known to us in matter,
and no process ever seen by us in matter and force, can
ever <i>explain</i>.</p>

<p>No doubt the most profound and active minds amongst
men will always endeavour to correlate the access even of
mind, with modifications of cerebral and neural matter.
But if that be approximately done, the real problem will
remain simply untouched. True, we can afford no better
explanations than those which philosophy offers; but we
may not blind ourselves to the true value of these. Mind
is inseverably associated with neural matter; we do not
know, and cannot even think of it, as emerging as a product
of neural matter. We must distinguish clearly between
scientific evidence and plausibilities of a philosophical kind
expressed in scientific language. We shall be fascinated
again and again with a brilliant intellectual arrangement of
things known, with things guessed, leading to hypothetical
‘interpretations’ of the most impenetrable mysteries. But
the fact remains, that the activities of intellect are inexpressible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
in terms of matter and motion. Mind only can
give origin to mind. Until it is congruous to think that
parallel lines can enclose a space, that 2+2=7, that out
of nothing something can come, it will be incongruous, in
spite of subtle and ceaseless effort, to construct hypotheses

shall come forth as an unaided and necessary product of
matter as affected by motion.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
